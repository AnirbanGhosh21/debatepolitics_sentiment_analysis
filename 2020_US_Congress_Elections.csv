The White House has...www.dailykos.com11/13/20It's been 181 days since the House passed the $3 trillion HEROES Act, and 42 days since the House passed a compromise $2.2 trillion bill, both of which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConell has refused to take up for a vote. The White House has gone AWOL, with the squater in the Oval Office refusing to do anything beyond tweeting conspiracy theories about a rigged election, while his staff tries to figure out how to cover their asses and find new jobs. The lame duck administration has withdrawn enirely from negotiations.  With new infections and deaths from coronavirus reaching crisis levels in every single state in the counry, McConell is still insisting that $500 billion is his absolute limit, and sen Senate Finance Commitee Chairman Chuck Grassley out to tell reporters that he ""is not going to rely on Mnuchin any more to do the dealing.  That economic crisis is far too real for millions of Americans out of work, who are facing food insecurity and homelessness. It's far too real for the small business owners who employ millions around the counry. So far, something like 100,000 small businesses have been forced to close around the counry. The Paycheck Protection Program loans some got in the spring have run out and there are no other options for them right now, because Republicans wan to coninue to pretend that this crisis is over.A big, big deal isn't even what Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are demanding: $2.4 trillion. At this poin, it's going to take more along the lines of $10 trillion to really rescue the counry. That has a greater chance of happening in January or February, but how many more businesses will be lost by then? Not to menion lives. That will also only happen if Democrats take the Senate with the Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock runoff elections in Georgia. We need a breakthrough, and itxe2x80x99s just not going to happen with McConell conrolling the Senate.

Cameron,"While a blue wave would have sen a strong message to Republicans to knock of the nonsense, I think that it might not necessarily be bad that Dems will only have a very small majority in the House.  Republicans in purple districts will have incenive to appear reasonable and not unduly obstructive, for fear of losing their seats two years from now.Compare that to what happened in 2008.  Democrats had a large majority of the House due to their Blue Dogs.  But those Blue Dogs actually had the opposite incenives the purple Republicans will have now.  They had to be careful to make it appear like they were moderating the liberal influences of a fully Democrat-conrolled governmen.  As a result they often obstructed their own party and ultimately were voted out in 2010 anyway.Now I don't know much about the Republicans who flipped seats this election.  I don't know if they are Trumpist or conservative ideologues who will oppose anything and everything that Dems do out of principle and risk their own seats in the hope of a Republican majority in 2 years, or people who are serious about solving problems and/or primarily concerned with keeping their own seats.  But I do think that the conditions and underlying incenives exist for a some actual bipartisan work to get done.The same is true in the Senate.  Looks like the Republican moderates will have survived this election, and there are a number of Republican senators up for reelection in purple states in 2 years.  With only 1-2 swing votes needed, there is an opportunity for moderate Republicans to make a name for themselves by working with the other side, as respected Republicans like McCain used to do.",19,,,Moderat

Bucky,"TurtleDude saidWe heard over and over about a blue wave.  Conservative pollsters such as Frank Lunz and left-wingers both failed big time: and ABC /Washington Post poll claimed Biden had a 17 poin lead in Wisconsin. The Democrats threw hundreds of millions at trying to defeat Collins, Ernst, Graham and McConell and they all won fairly easily. Bloomberg wasted a reported 100 million in Florida to defeat Trump in that state and failed. We wonder how many votes were suppressed by the medial and pollsters claiming Biden was going to win easily.

A ""new kind of Republican."" The only woman in Senate GOP leadership. And veteran lawmakers whoxe2x80x99ve been in the mix on most every major bipartisan deal over the past decade. These are a few of the Republican senators Presiden Donald Trump has put at risk this November, through his divisive style of politics, handling of the pandemic and close alliance with the Senate GOP.

And thatxe2x80x99s probably affected the races of a number of my colleagues,xe2x80x9d said Sen. Mit Romney (R-Utah), who opposes Trumpxe2x80x99s reelection. Senate Republicans ener Election Day with an outside shot at protecting their 53-seat majority, particularly if Trump can overperform expectations in Senate batlegrounds. But even a surprise hold will probably sweep away some prominen Republicans that otherwise might have had a beter chance if Trump were a more convenional presiden.  Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado, an upbeat freshman who won in a blue state in 2014, and Air Force veteran Martha McSally of Arizona are the most endangered senators after Democrat Doug Jones of Alabama. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), the No. 5 GOP leader and another a military veteran, is also vulnerable.Deeper ino the seniority ranks, cenrist Sen. Susan Collins is narrowly trailing Democrat Sara Gideon in Maine. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a frequen deal seeker on immigration and other issues, is clinging to a small lead over Jaime Harrison. And things are closer than expected for John Cornyn of Texas, who hopes to succeed Sen. Mitch McConell (R-Ky.) as party leader one day. Freshman GOP Sen. Thom Tillis has hugged Trump tight in North Carolina, but it may not be enough as Joe Biden polls slightly ahead of the presiden there, too. Trump needs to win there for Tillis to survive, officials say. While Senate races in many states are essenially a referendum on Trump, they will shape what comes next from the Republican Party regardless of whether hexe2x80x99s reelected.

Rogue Valley,"Republican Sen. Mike Lee said fact-checking is a form of censorship10/29/20During a Senate hearing on Wednesday, Republican Sen. Mike Lee said fact-checking is a form of censorship. The Senate Commerce Commitee held the hearing with CEOs of Twiter, Facebook, and Google to discuss Section 230 and Republican' concerns over censorship online. Senate Republicans said the companies had discriminated against conservative views on their platforms. Lee, the senior US senator from Utah, addressed the CEOs about their conen moderation policies, which he said were disproportionately applied to conservative ideologies. He defined what he considered ""censorship"" in regards to the way conen is treated on these platforms. ""When I use the word'censor' here, I'm meaning blocked conen, fact check, or labeled conen, or demonetized websites of conservative, Republican, or pro-life individuals or groups or companies,"" Lee said. During the hearing, Senate Republicans largely focused on the tech companies' efforts to fact-check tweets from Trump that conain false or misleading information, particularly about COVID-19 and the election. Earlier this year, Twiter and Facebook both began fact-checking or labeling posts from Trump, among others.Click to expand...Senator Lee (R-UT) exemplifies the low IQ types that the GOP advances for public office.The Republicans are irritated because Twiter/Facebook/Google are fact-checking [habitual liar] Donald Trump, and killing Giuliani conspiracy smears against Joe Biden",34,Male,,Independen

Garcia: 'To Fix the Nation, You've Got to Start with CaliforniaGarcia blasted Democrats' failing policies in California and said he sees more opportunities for red seats in his very blue state.www.breitbart.comxe2x80x9cA lot of the ill that wexe2x80x99re experiencing here in what should be a very beautiful state, a very thriving state, are now being uploaded to the federal level. Ixe2x80x99m runing against someone whoxe2x80x99s represening us in Sacrameno who has signed about three billion dollars worth of tax increases over the last 18 monhs, someone who has called for the defunding of police in a district where we have the highest concenration of both active and retired law enforcemen officers and first responders.She supported this AB5 bill and a lot of detail underneath AB5, but this is the thing that is effectively pushing Uber and Lyft out of our state. Wexe2x80x99re surrounded by flames and these wildfire seasons that are geting longer, and theyxe2x80x99re blaming it on climate change rather than investing in deforestation, or buying new large aerial tankers to fight these fires and do something about it proactively.So to me the overarching theme and umbrella right now is about public safet, and again itxe2x80x99s not about Republicans versus Democrats, itxe2x80x99s about investing in our communities so they stay safe, investing in our law enforcemen, firefighting assets, taking care of our veterans and our seniors before we take care of the illegals, which is a thing thatxe2x80x99s happening in California right now, and geting through this COVID crisis, rebuilding businesses, and opening up our schools and giving parens school choice, it all comes down to public safety and being able to survive and stay in California and the larger mission is making sure our nation doesnxe2x80x99t become California.xe2x80x9dYou really have to live here to appreciate what this guy is saying but if you live in the southern states, you can feel the effect of it as factories move and set up shop in your home states. Unlike many blue states and cities, Californiaxe2x80x99s problems are truly self inflicted. The other blue states donxe2x80x99t have the tax base California does. They have the poor and no money. The difference is the way California, who has the poor and a declining ability txe2x80x9chavexe2x80x9d money, throws billions at politically popular but wrong solutions to problems.In a strange way, if I have to see a Biden victory Ixe2x80x99m going to enjoy watching the economics play out as the blue states begin to face the wall of debt they have accumulated and now due to falling revenue, have no good options but to face bankruptcy. Talk about a hate fest.

Fearing Democratxe2x80x99 impeachmen push would end his career in a southern New Jersey district won by Presiden Donald Trump, Rep. Jeff Van Drew dropped thexe2x80x9cDxe2x80x9d next to his name and joined the GOP. But nearly one year and a global pandemic later, Van Drewxe2x80x99s pledge to give hisxe2x80x9cundying supportxe2x80x9d to Trump could end up sinking the freshman lawmaker. Van Drew, like many of his Republican colleagues, now finds himself having to answer for an unpopular presiden, whose shaky handling of the coronavirus and inflammatory rhetoric has damaged the GOPxe2x80x99s standing nationwide, especially in the suburbs. Van Drew currenly trails in the polls to a well-funded Democratic challenger in Amy Kenedy, a former public school teacher who married ino the Kenedy political dynasty. Kenedy is leading Van Drew by five poins among registered voters, according to a Monmouth University poll from earlier this monh, though itxe2x80x99s within the surveyxe2x80x99s margin of error.  Democrats have tried to use Van Drewxe2x80x99s party change and sudden embrace of Trump as a cudgel, branding him asxe2x80x9cswitcheroo Van Drewxe2x80x9d and accusing him of betraying his constituens for his own self inerests.xe2x80x9cIt felt like he was willing to do or say anything to keep his job,xe2x80x9d said Kenedy, who decided to run for office after hearing Van Drew promise his unwavering loyalty to Trump.xe2x80x9cThere are a lot of people in the district who really respect someone who can be independen-minded, but thatxe2x80x99s not what that felt like to them.xe2x80x9dYet despite pledging his fealty to Trump in an Oval Office sit-down, Van Drew now says he is not beholden to any leaderxe2x80x94 including the presiden. The match-up between Van Drew and Kenedyxe2x80x94 which has become one of the most hotly-conested races in the counryxe2x80x94 has drawn national atenion, with outside resources pouring in. Democrats are not only eager to win back a seat they thought they had already seized in 2018, but also seek revenge for Van Drewxe2x80x99s high-profile defection. Switching parties has yielded mixed results in the past, so it was always going to be an electoral gamble for Van Drew, strategists say. He risks infuriating the Democrats who backed him in 2018, while therexe2x80x99s no guaranee Republican voters will trust him. And independens might be turned off by his tight embrace of Trump. On the coronavirus, Van Drew has echoed Trumpxe2x80x99s rhetoric. He railed against health restrictions dampening the economy, highlighted how Trump overcame the virus, criticized D.C. residens for wearing masks Nearly half of registered voters said they were bothered by Van Drew now runing for Congress as a Republican, according to the Monmouth University poll.Click to expand...I really hope the good people of New Jersey's 2nd congressional district kickxe2x80x9cswitcheroo Van Drewxe2x80x9d to the curb.He sold his miserable soul to Donald Trump.

The answer is no. Sabrina Singh, Harris' press secretary, was quick to call out Perdue's behavior. ""Well that is incredibly racist,"" she said on Twiter, urging voters to cast their ballots for his Democratic rival Jon Ossoff. A spokeswoman for Perdue's campaign pathetically atempted to gaslight and defend the senator's remarks.  ""Senator Perdue simply mispronounced Senator Harris' name, and he didn't mean anything by it,"" said Casey Black. Black can keep her atempt to spin for her boss because too many immigrans and people of color across America have personal and painful stories of being bullied over our names. As the clip of Perdue quickly became viral online, people of color started sharing their traumatic experiences of being ""otherized.The poin is we all have our own Perdue story. People with differen and ""ethnic"" sounding names have all been ridiculed and mocked. That's why watching Perdue go after Harris triggered many of us because our names are a fundamenal part of our idenity. They tell the story of not only who we are but where we came from. They tell the story of America. There is obviously also a larger dog-whistle at play here that's insinuating that names that sound foreign and non-White and are less American. But who gets to decide what names are American or not American enough? As much as Trump and his Republican admirers might seem to wan to take us back to an America of the past, their outdated racism shtick is reeking of GOP desperation to win the election at any cost.

""I think the Senate is tough actually. The Senate is very tough,"" Trump said, according to an atendee who shared the Presiden's commens on condition of anonymity with the Post. ""There are a couple senators I can't really get involved in. I just can't do it. You lose your soul if you do. I can't help some of them. I don't wan to help some of them.""  Trump's commens were made at a closed-door gathering held in Nashville, Tenessee, before the last presidenial debate, according to the Post, where he said that he thinks the GOP will ""take back the House.""  Trump's commens come at a time when Republicans in tight down-ballot races, who had hoped to ride the Presiden's coatails to victory, have litle desire to align with him.Trump's standing in the polls has alarmed some Republicans, who are struggling to hold on to their 53-47 Senate majority as Democrats see their opportunities to pick up seats coninue to grow.

That's why we need to take the senate.But this also needs to happen on the State Level.    Inerstate governance has abused so much within states that wreak havoc upon and across the nation.  This goes all the way down to ""city councils"".Republicanism of Today... is a damaging force to America's Advancemens.It's great to get the Federal Congress, but it is also importan to get the in-state congress as well.   Then we can have unilateral progressive developmens from the botom up.We can also fix the Voting System, where there are enough Polling Places where people don't have to stand in excessively long lines.  We can fix all the things that damage the voice of the people, and we can push to have'Federal, State and Local Campaign Financing""... as well as we the people and push to remove the claim of Corporation as Person.   Which pits money against the voice of the people.    Any Lobbying Campaigning, can clearly be understood by the people as to where those voices are coming from and what's behind them.These things are why Democracy was designed for an ""INTELLEGENT SOCIETY""....  it was not designed for drama addicts.  Although we know it was structured for the wealthy, white men, as they hijacked it and claimed voting was for white men, as the only one considered as Person, if he was a land or business owners,...  over time, the poor white man got to vote, but his vote was conrolled by the wealthy, so technically he had litle voice, but much gerrymandered dictations dominating him like a groomed serf.It took a while for women to get to vote, but the system of'white nationalism of wealthy white male dominance"" still influenced the early votes of women, because the society was still seeing the woman with an apron and housewife, dependen on the white man to provide for her.   When the vote came to Blacks without the Segregationist Voter Discrimination and Repressions, only then did white women figure out that the many steps that of Civil Rights movemens  that led to the 1964 Civil Rights movemen was something she too could ride to claim voice, not just in how she votes, but the fact that she could earn her own income.    These movemens were supported by the more liberal minded who leaned to equality, but there were as there still are many that wan to cling to ideology taught to them by their parens and grandparens who came from the Jim Crow groomed society,  even though they pushed against it, some parts they did not rid themselves of, because it was embedded in their childhood developmenal concepts.Today, the young from grade schools, through University... are now aware that without Equality For All, they too don't have the Equality their previous generations thought they had.When we as a people take back the Governmen and Make it For and About and Of The People... we will Rebuild, Unions, we will create a system of trade that understand that America must produce no less than 40+% of what it consumes.  This can bring durable products back to the forefron, and repairable products that can again support a robust system of repair and replacemen part labor markets... because it's conducive to environmenal friendly conservation of raw materials.

That's 52 years from then and Barry Goldwater losing to Donald Trump pulling it off.While Goldwater was a patriot who had differen approaches that were often bizarre, this time will be worse for the Republicans and their Party because Republicans-Conservatives have become what we fought against throughout the 20th cenury.

A leter sen by Johnson to the Senate ethics commitee in May has revealed the senator began the process of selling a company he partly owned in February 2018, just monhs after he insisted the Trump administration change a portion of the tax law in a way that ultimately benefited the sale.  Questions began swirling around Johnsonxe2x80x99s sale of stock in Pacur in March, when it was first disclosed. Press reports questioned whether the timing of the sale reflected insider information Johnson had gleaned about the Covid-19 pandemic in his role as head of the Senate homeland security commitee.  Four monhs earlier, Johnson became the first Republican senator to anounce that he would vote against Trumpxe2x80x99s tax bill if it did not give beter treatmen to so-calledxe2x80x9cpass-throughxe2x80x9d enities, or companies that are taxed at rates for individual taxpayers but whose profits are distributed to owners. Johnsonxe2x80x99s threat paid off and a change to improve the tax rate for pass-throughs was added to the law, which Johnson supported.  The change was recognized at the time as increasing the value of pass-through enities. Johnson sold his stock in his own pass-through company, Pacur, a plastics company he previously ran with is brother-in-law, on 2 March 2020, generating profits of as much as $25m on the sale. In 2017, Johnson said his stake was worth between $1m and $5m. Johnson has led a campaign in the Senate to launch unfounded allegations against Joe Bidenxe2x80x99s son, Huner. On Fox News, Johnson recenly accused Bidenxe2x80x99s son of using his family name to makexe2x80x9cmillionxe2x80x9d in shady overseas deals.

Rogue Valley,"This year, conrol of the Senate is an even bigger deal than ever10/12/20The Senate is in play this election year, and not just because partisan conrol is up for grabs, though it is: Analyses by both RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight make the Democrats favorites to recapture the majority, currenly held by the Republicans, 53 to 47. In a more profound sense, voters are being asked to confron and consider the upper chamberxe2x80x99s institutional role under the Constitution, which is rapidly evolving ino a partisan issue. Unil now, there was broad acceptance of the Senatxe2x80x99s counermajoritarian function, and of the multiple ways that its two-members-per-state design, coupled with six-year terms, encourage coninuity, deliberation and compromise. The conrast with the House of Represenatives, which turns over bienially and allots power according to population, was taken for graned. Republicans still generally favor the status quo; it wonxe2x80x99t change if they keep the majority. Democrats, however, are furious at how Majority Leader Mitch McConell (R-Ky.) has exploited Senate procedures to promote his agenda and thwart theirs. Eager to enact an ambitious policy agenda and confiden of wining the House and the presidency, they increasingly favor structural Senate change. Undoubtedly, the GOP-conrolled Senate looms as an obstacle to major legislation, including most recenly a fiscal stimulus package for the virus-ravaged economy. Can the chamber be rendered less dysfunctional and more responsive under Democratic conrol, while preserving itxe2x80x9cuniquexe2x80x9d features?That would depend on there being a sufficien number of senators who still believe that politics is a repeat-player game in which todayxe2x80x99s majority is tomorrowxe2x80x99s minority, not a zero-sum proposition. Small states and their senators will play a crucial part: Of the 50 states, 22 possess six or fewer electoral votes. This group encompasses 14 red states but also eight blue ones with 15 Democratic senators among them. One exit strategy might be a deal between small-state Democrats on the one hand and the GOP leader on the other, whereby McConell would allow votes on Democratic legislation in return for preserving the filibuster, at least in modified form, and not admiting new states. To imagine such a deal is to admit how far-fetched it is: The Republican base would react with fury; Democrats who did business with McConell, rather than give him a taste of his own medicine, could be inviting primary challenges. And what would the position be of a Presiden Joe Biden, longtime man of the Senate, from tiny Delaware, all but surely a one-termer who has a history of negotiating with McConellxe2x80x94 and has poinedly not called for an end to the filibuster? All of the above is speculation, to be sure.

About a half-dozen seats fall in that categoryxe2x80x94 the lowest of low-hanging fruit for Republicans. But most private and public surveys from both parties show either dead heats or the Democratic incumben with a modest lead. Their success stems from Democratxe2x80x99 massive fundraising advanage as well as some Republican recruitmen struggles. And in a few places, Trump has become so toxic that hexe2x80x99s dragging down GOP candidates where he was once overwhelmingly popular.  House GOP super PACs have reserved and spen millions ino these seats, trying to keep pace with well-funded Democratic incumbenxe2x80x94 in some cases, without much movemen in the polls. Republican' 2020 argumen was that Presiden Donald Trump would be a boon to their prospects in flipping the 30 Democratic-held districts he carried in 2016. In reality, they are seriously conesting perhaps a dozen of them, and Democrats could even expand their majority.  Democrats increasingly believe that the 2016 presidenial race represened close to a low-water mark for the part's downballot candidates, said Dan Sena, former executive director of the DCCC.Republican' outlays against a handful of the most beatable Democrats have hampered their ability to craft a serious path back to the majority. Democrats have seized on their cash advanage to conest districts in deep-red territory, forcing the GOP to retrench and protect incumbens and open seats. As of mid-October, national Republicans are playing more defense than offense, airing TV ads in 28 GOP-held districts compared to 25 Democratic-held ones, according to a POLITICO analysis of data from Advertising Analytics, a TV tracking firm.xe2x80x9cWexe2x80x99re able to flip the tables and focus on expanding the map.

""They are tied down in districts that I think they expected that they would be able to win easily. But it is not that type of year."" In most well-educated suburban districts, Trump is proving just as burdensome as he was in the 2018 midterms. In Oklahoma's 5th District, Horn shocked the political world by upseting an unprepared incumben. Trump won the seat by 13 poins, but some private polling now indicates a tight presidenial conest there. It's still a top pickup opportunity for Republicans. But they don't have a clear lead yet, despite millions in outside spending and a more compelling and well-funded nominee in state Sen. Stephanie Bice.

Rogue Valley,"Opinion | Will Amy Coney Barret Cost Republicans the Senate?Mitch McConell has a tricky needle to thread.www.nytimes.comMitch McConell has a tricky needle to thread.9/25/20Mitch McConell, the Senate majority leader, delights in confirming Republican-nominated jurists. District courts, appeals courts, most especially the Supreme Courtxe2x80x94 he wans to fill them all. In fact, with his partxe2x80x99s having largely given up on legislating in recen years, this may be what Mr. McConell regards as his main duty. It is certainly the part at which he excels. But for Mr. McConell to keep this job, his party must keep conrol of the Senate. And that challenge got considerably more ulcer-inducing with the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last week. As has been noted, Mr. McConell finds himself in the rare situation where his two lovesxe2x80x94 holding power and confirming judgesxe2x80x94 are in tension. One early data poin that has Democrats feeling good: money. Since Justice Ginsburgxe2x80x99s death, conributions have come pouring ino progressive groups and individual campaigns at a level that political veterans say is unlike anything theyxe2x80x99ve ever seen. ActBlue, which focuses on small-dollar donations, pulled in more than $100 million last weekend. For some of Mr. McConellxe2x80x99s members, the focus on the courts could be a lifelinxe2x80x94 for others, a millstone. The most likely casualties are Cory Gardner in Colorado and Susan Collins in Maine. These blue-state Republicans were already having trouble convincing independens and moderates that they arenxe2x80x99t Trump tools while not alienating their base voters, who expect them to be precisely thatNot that Mr. McConell had a choice. In the midst of all the handicapping, the confirmation drama should serve as a reminder that ideas still mater in politicsxe2x80x94 though perhaps not in the way one would think. Republican voters have long been motivated, far more than Democrats, by a hunger to shift the courts in their direction. This is partly because of conservative opposition to abortion and the desire to see Roe v. Wade overturned. They are increasingly couning on conservative jurists to take their side in the culture wars and save them from the horrors of modernity (i.e. becoming the racial/ethnical minority). Republican lawmakers recognize that the partxe2x80x99s policy positions, what few it has left, anyway, tend to lack broad appeal. As the Republican commenator Amanda Carpener observed onxe2x80x9cThe Bulwark Podcastxe2x80x9d this week, over the past decade, Republicans gave up on consensus building and doinxe2x80x9cthe hard work of passing laws,xe2x80x9d and instead are aiming txe2x80x9chave the courts solve our problems.xe2x80x9d Even with total conrol of the governmen, Republicans failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, which they had been promising for years. Instead, they have kicked it to the courts to dismanle. Republicans understand that ideas mater. They also know that having apparenly run out of appealing ones, they must find other ways to exert power. For them, these court fights are increasingly a mater of political life and death.Click to expand...I personally think ""Moscow"" Mitch McConell, both a politician and a strategist, will hold a Senate SCOTUS confirmation vote asap figuring that this will help more GOP Senators up for reelection (like Lindsey Graham and perhaps Lisa Murkowski) than hurt others who are probably already dead meat (such as Susan Collins and Cory Gardner).

randel,"Rogue Valley saidOpinion | Will Amy Coney Barret Cost Republicans the Senate?Mitch McConell has a tricky needle to thread.www.nytimes.comMitch McConell has a tricky needle to thread.I personally think ""Moscow"" Mitch McConell, both a politician and a strategist, will hold a Senate SCOTUS confirmation vote asap figuring that this will help more GOP Senators up for reelection (like Lindsey Graham and perhaps Lisa Murkowski) than hurt others who are probably already dead meat (such as Susan Collins and Cory Gardner).  I tend to think stacking the Supreme Court with a 6-3 conservative majority and lifetime appoinmens is more importan to McConell than remaining the Senate Majority Leader for the next four years. By and large, Republicans have given up on ataining party goals via the Congressional-legislative route,  and instead now look to the courts to advance their various agenda. It's difficult to say anymore what ideology the GOP still holds dear, since it has cast aside all traditional Republican/conservative values under Donald Trump and Trumpism.Click to expand...sadly, i agree, stacking the court is more importan to him than mainaining the majority...he sees which way the wind is blowing, and his majority is in grave danger.",72,Male,,Cenrist

That is why we still have courts dominated by judges with beliefs that do not align with how society thinks now and why we have rural red states dominate blue ones with much bigger populations. f course, they did gave  reasons to justfy their decisions for ameliorating the impact of democratic will and presened their decisions as   an atempt to  ""ameliorate the impact of momenary passions"" which they always associate withe the ignoran masses and not with the minosities  but they actually set up the system in a way that made the represenatives of the House become closely associated to the ""momenaty passions"" of their constitutuens. If Senators were forced to have elections every two years and the House Represenatives themselves were elected every six years, you would have by design the opposite - meaning senators focusing  more on short term passions and represenatives have a  long-term political visionI agree with what you say about the Constitution and the powers it graned it. I will say though that we should not assume that the Constitution will always serve socieatal needs without changes. For example, we live in a world where urbanization rate is constanly increasing and a Constitution with the Democratic constrains that currenly exist seem to gradually become less and less responsive to the voice of the urban  majority and more responsive to a shrinking, rural-based minority. We have already seen in recen years more frequen cases of presidens governing  without gaining the popular vote, and senates conrolled by the less densely populated states whcih also do not represen the majority of population. And we also see how on the one hand the American society becomes more diverse, less religious and more toleran of issues that are appaulling to religious conservatives, like gay rights, and at the same tme we see a shift of the courts towars more conservative judges.

Rogue Valley,"The Republican Senate nightmare is coming true8/12/20At the start of the 2020 election cycle -- way back in December 2018 -- the convenional wisdom was that while Democrats might be able to retake the Senate majority, it was a long shot. It's a very long way from that assumption to this headline from the Cook Political Report, a non-partisan campaign handicapping site, late last monh: ""Almost 100 Days Out, Democrats Are Favored to Take Back the Senate."" ""Ultimately, every day that Trump stubbornly refuses to change course [on the coronavirus pandemic] is another day that it becomes increasingly likely he may not only tank his own re-election bid but could be on a kamikaze mission to take the Republican-held Senate down with him. At this poin, a net gain of five to seven seats for Democrats looks far more probable than the one to three seat gain that would leave them shy of a majority."" That is a very big deal. Cook currenly puts Arizona Sen. Martha McSally (R) as a clear underdog to win in November while ratings GOP-held seats in Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Monana and North Carolina as pure toss-ups. By conrast, Cook sees only one Democratic seat in real jeopardy: Alabama -- where Sen. Doug Jones (D) is an underdog against former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville (R).It's very hard to overestimate how much of a sea change it would be for Democrats to not only capture the White House, but the Senate in November. If that came to pass, Democrats would have full conrol of the executive and legislative branches for the first time since 2009-2011, in the first term of Presiden Barack Obama. And as Presiden Donald Trump and curren Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConell (Kenucky) have shown with their bevy of confirmed federal judges -- including two Supreme Court seats -- conrolling the White House and the Senate allows the party in charge to make potenially generational changes. If this nightmare scenario for Republicans comes to pass, it is likely to stoke the already bubbling conversation about what a post-Trump GOP could and should look like. Unfortunately for Republicans, that conversation could well take place as their party is effectively sidelined in terms of power in WashingtonClick to expand...The only surefire way to right the course of this counry is via the Democrats flipping the GOP Senate on November 3rd.Without that, GOP Majority Leader'Moscow' Mitch McConell will ensure a Congressional stalemate and botleneck for the next four years.Related: Democrats say White House isn't budging in coronavirus relief stalemat",94,Male,,Independen

Very unusual in factAny incumben not 5+ poins ahead consistenly throughout the campaign would be right to lose the litle sleep time the incumben gets. Shaking up the campaign staff and organization rarely changes anything. It's about the incumben period and it's not good for the incumben and the incumben's party.An incumben with a money advanage and name recognition who has a large number of undecideds needs to get a rain dance going for election day.An incumben Republican in trouble in Mississippi says a lot about the color blue and about water that takes the shape of a wave.

Six weeks out may as well be six years. A hellovalot more is going to occur, the debates especially and in particular, and this sucker is going to get very wild.The botom line is that the wilder it gets the beter for bromide Joe and I don't say bromide negatively. The vast majority of Americans wan the next four years to be defined by peace and calm coming out of the White House and Washington. Relatively anyway.This translates ino the voters puting the Democrats in charge of everything. Voters know the D's would run the show for two years unil the midterm in 2022, then take things from there, so any perceived risk factor of Harris is not seen as being great. It's only this week that I am saying blue and wave because the polling is breaking as we move to the cusp of October, the breaking is showing Republican candidates starting to go under, and it's occurring across the board from the east coast to Iowa to Arizona to include Georgia where Biden and Trump are tied exactly.It's reminiscen of 1992 when voters wrote off GHW from early on and wen with the other guy who turned out to be Counerfeit Bill.

In this case, they created the unaffordable health care act, which hurt the middle class tax payer. Here is a link from the CMS or Cener for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The enire article can be read at the link below.Thank Obamacare for the Rise of the Uninsured | CMSThe U.S. Census Bureau released their anual report on health insurance coverage in the United States which shows the number of uninsured Americans rose from 2017 to 2018.   As usual, critics of Presiden Trump have been quick to blame the Administrationxe2x80x99s healthcare policies for this increase.  But a review of key facts suggests the rising uninsured rate stems largely from Obamacarexe2x80x99s failure to deliver affordable health insurance premiums and has created a new class of uninsured.While Obamacare promised affordable health insurance for every American, and even penalized those who refused to buy it, the law did nothing to conrol underlying costs.  The very structure of the law which imposed billions of dollars in new, costly regulations also led to higher and higher insurance premiums.As a result, when Presiden Trump took office in 2017, average individual market health insurance premiums in states using HealthCare.gov had already doubled when compared to 2013, the year before Obamacarexe2x80x99s main regulations took effect.  Average premiums wen up by another 26 percen in 2018.At the same time individual market premiums were spiking out of conrol, Ceners for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) data show a substanial enrollmen drop among unsubsidized people on the individual market who do not receive federal premium tax credits.  In just two years, from 2016 to 2018, unsubsidized enrollmen declined by 2.5 million people, a 40 percen drop.These numbers clearly show Obamacare has created a serious affordability problem on the individual marketxe2x80x94and this was all put in motion before Presiden Trump took office. Letxe2x80x99s remember that insurersxe2x80x99 process for seting rates for 2018 was well under way at the begining of 2017 when Presiden Trump took office and based on policies set in place under the Obama AdministrationClick to expand...Simply put, there are too many people without subsidies who canot afford coverage under Obamacare.  For example, when a 60-year old couple in Grand Island, Nebraska making $70,000 a yearxe2x80x94which is just slightly too much to qualify for Obamacarexe2x80x99s premium subsidyxe2x80x94is faced with paying $38,000, over half of their yearly income, to buy a silver plan with an $11,100 anual maximum out-of-pocket limit.  We should not be surprised if they make the tough decision to drop their coverage. With a similar cold reality facing millions of American families, it was inevitable that Obamacarexe2x80x99s affordability crisis would evenually show up in the rates of uninsured Americans.The data show that the number of uninsured with incomes greater than 400 percen of the federal poverty line (FPLxe2x80x94the cutoff poin to qualify for federal tax creditxe2x80x94increased by 1.1 million in 2018.   The number of uninsured with incomes between 300 and 399 percen of FPL who might qualify for smaller Obamacare tax credits, but still must pay a large portion of premium on their own, increased by 500,000.  The total increase in the number of uninsured with incomes higher than 300 percen of FPL represens 85 percen of the 1.9 million additional uninsured.Together these data show how Obamacare created an enirely new class of uninsured individuals, among those with middle to higher incomes who donxe2x80x99t quality for governmen subsidies and canxe2x80x99t afford coverage because of skyrocketing premiums.Click to expand...",101,Male,,Slightly Conservative

The state senator Barbara Bollier, a former Republican and physician, is the vehicle for these ambitionxe2x80x93 which if they came off could decide whether the party grabs overall conrol of the US Senate in January.

When asked if she thought her chances of wining the seat had shrunk when Marshall beat Kobach, Bollier pushed back and poined to Medicaid expansionxe2x80x9cThis state desperately wans and needs Medicaid expansion and healthcare access.
