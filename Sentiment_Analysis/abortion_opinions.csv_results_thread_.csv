They also said the two-visit requiremen poses logistical challenges for patiens and clinics that cause abortions to be delayed far beyond the 48 hours required by law, pushing some women ino surgical abortions, which have greater risks of complications. A few women are pushed beyond the time when they can receive an abortion altogether.Friedman found that the evidence supported those claims because second trimester abortions had increased since the law wen ino effect and safer medication abortions had decreased.In addition, Friedman said the mandatory waiting period isxe2x80x9cgratuitously demeaning"" by treating women as incapable of making rational decisions.xe2x80x9cDefendanxe2x80x99 suggestion that women are overly emotional and must be required to cool off or calm down before having a medical procedure they have decided they wan to have, and that they are constitutionally enitled to have, is highly insulting and paternalisticxe2x80x93 and all the more so given that no such waiting periods apply to men,"" he wrote.",19,Male,,Moderat,0.4883446712018141,0.07983560090702949

Casper,"briar rose saidSenator Gary Peters has shared his familyxe2x80x99s experience with abortion amid what he says isxe2x80x9ca pivotal momen for reproductive freedomxe2x80x9d in the US. (Gety ImagesGary Peters, a Democratic senator from Michigan, has opened up for the first time about his family's painful experience with abortionIn an Elle inerview published on Monday, Mr Peters explained that his first wife, Heidi, underwen an abortion in the late 1980s that saved her life. At the time, Heidi was four monhs pregnan with the couple's second child, a baby they both waned. But during Heidi's second trimester, her water broke, leaving the fetus without amniotic fluid.The couple was told to wait at home for a miscarriage to naturally occur, but after that didn't happen, their doctor recommended an abortion because the fetus had no chance of survival. However, the Detroit hospital had a policy baning abortions, so Mr Peters and Heidi were told again to wait for a miscarriage.As they waited, Heidi's health deteriorated. When they returned to the hospital on the third day, the doctor said she could lose her uterus if she wasn't able to have an abortion, and she could die if she became septic from the uterine infection. Even so, the hospital board refused the doctor's appeal for an exception to the ani-abortion policy. The doctor recommended the couple find another physician to do the procedure quickly, and Heidi was rushed ino an emergency abortion that ""saved her uterus and possibly her life,"" according to Elle.In a statemen to the magazine, Heidi said the experience was ""painful and traumatic"". She added, ""If it weren't for urgen and critical medical care, I could have lost my life.In telling his story, Mr Peters has become the first siting senator in US history to publicly share a personal experience with abortion. He told Elle he decided to go public now because ""it's importan for folks to understand that these things happen to folks every day.He coninued, ""I've always considered myself pro-choice and believe women should be able to make these decisions themselves, but when you live it in real life, you realize the significan impact it can have on a family.The timing couldn't have been more appropriate. Confirmation hearings began Monday for Presiden Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barret, who opposes abortion. As a law professor, Ms Barret was among hundreds who signed an ani-abortion leter calling for an end ""to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade,"" the 1973 decision that legalized abortionMr Peters told Elle that he will not vote to confirm Ms Barret. He said, ""The new Supreme Court nominee could make a decision that will have major ramifications for reproductive health for women for decades to come. This is a pivotal momen for reproductive freedom.Mr Peters is runing a tight re-election campaign against John James, a Republican who openly opposes abortion and called it a form of ""genocide.This is the problem when religion gets involved in politics.

As the unborn child grows the states inerest increases.  Virtually every case the court has taken up since is about the poin where the states inerests exceeds the individuals privacy rights.Hence, my conenion that Roe v. Wade will never be overturned...  Far more than abortion depends on this concept..Click to expand...A simple look at the differen stages of fetus developmen demonstrates why this makes sense.  A fetus does not begin to resemble a human being unil about the fourth monh.  91% of abortions are performed at less than 13 weeks gestation.  Another 7.7% are performed between 14-20 weeks.  My suspicion is that the vast majority of the remaining 1.3% are undertaken for medical reasons.I believe that ""life"" begins at conception, but no one will ever convince me that aborting a form of life the shape and size of a pea is in any way equivalen to killing a human baby, as opposed to many other forms of life which we humans take for various reasons every day without bating an eye.Although I know it's uncomfortable, I think people should also keep in mind that by some estimates 57 million abortions have occurred since Roe v. Wade.  If all of those pregnancies had come to term, that is an additional 57 million unwaned children, many or even most of them born ino poor, often single-paren households, to have grown up with very litle private or public resources.

weaver2,"weaver2 saidAnd you've made no effort to presen a view that you do care about mothers and childrenClick to expand...That was an instan,  irritated pop-off answer.  Let me re-phrase it.  Pro-life advocates have shown very litle evidence that they understand or care to understand about women faced with unplaned,  unwaned  pregnancies or the children born from them.  In fact it's safe to say that no pro-life advocate has ever posted anything that indicates they care at all  about women faced with such pregnancies other than to claim they shouldn't be having sex if they can't support a child.  You seem to think you have shown tremendous empathy for women and children.  Your posts say that empathy is not extended to  women faced with an unwaned pregnancy that will harm, may even destroy  her already born  family.The only reason abortion proponens call unborn offspring ""clumps of cells"" is to try to take the emotion of it so they feel beter about killing a young human. You can't take emotions out of it. You can lie to yourself and say that it's just like a tumor or a parasite, but that's just what it is -- lying. Geting pregnan is emotional. Being pregnan is emotional. Thinking about your unborn is emotional. Feeling your unborn grow inside of you is emotional. If you see nothing emotional about killing your unborn child then you're either exceptionally ignoran of basic biology or you're some kind of sociopath.Click to expand...Josie said'm sorry -- are you under the impression that Planed Parenhood is the only way for women to get medical care?Because, just like emotions, race can't be eliminated from the topic.  So only born black lives mater.  RightYes, emotions are always higher on the pro-life side because we DON'T ignore the facts.  We know a ZEF is a human and we find it abhorren that some people think those humans are property to be tossed away like trash.Incorrect.  Pro-choicers atempt to eliminate emotion from the conversation enirely.  When bringing up biological facts about fetal developmen, pro-choicers say you can't do that because it's an ""emotional plea.""  If I say that a 14-week gestation fetus has eyes, arms, legs, fingers, toes, pro-choicers don't wan to hear it -- it's an ""emotional plea.""  Hell yeah it's emotional.  It's a HUMAN - a CHILD- a litle baby.  Pro-choicers don't wan to think about a fetus having arms, legs, fingers, toes, eyes -- they wan to pretend that it's just a blob so that they don't feel that natural emotion.  Pro-choicers almost never admit that a ZEF is a human.  They say a ZEF is just a ""clump of cells,"" ""like a tumor,"" ""parasite"" or just a part of the mother's body when everyone who wen through 5th grade health class know that's not true.Click to expand...Do you not see the irony in your own reply here?

Josie,"weaver2 saidThat was an instan,  irritated pop-off answer.  Let me re-phrase it.  Pro-life advocates have shown very litle evidence that they understand or care to understand about women faced with unplaned,  unwaned  pregnancies or the children born from them.  In fact it's safe to say that no pro-life advocate has ever posted anything that indicates they care at all  about women faced with such pregnancies other than to claim they shouldn't be having sex if they can't support a child.  You seem to think you have shown tremendous empathy for women and children.  Your posts say that empathy is not extended to  women faced with an unwaned pregnancy that will harm, may even destroy  her already born  family.Click to expand...There are hundreds (if not thousands) of charities run by pro-life people that are designed to help women who are facing a pregnancy they aren't financially or emotionally ready for.  I support them as do many of my pro-life friends.  I am a teacher of very young studens.  I care very deeply about them and have financially supported their families often. I keep extra food in case one of my studens didn't get supper or breakfast or both.  I let them sleep when I can tell they were up all night long because their moron parens don't make them go to bed or showed them scary movies that keep them awake all night or they have some sort of turmoil going on at home.  I have purchased school supplies and clothing for my studens.  I have cried with my studens who are emotionally distraught and devastated.To say that pro-lifers don't care about born children is gross generalization that isn't at all what the majority of pro-lifers think or believe.

You are obviously a very caring day care provider.  What I said was that pro-life advocates didn't show any empathy or  understanding for women facing unwaned pregnancies.  The major shortcomings of Catholic and evangelical crisis pregnancy ceners  have been prety thoroughly exposed for what they really are, birth and adoption ceners masquerading as medical clinics. I'm sure you and other voluneers feel very moral every time you chalk up  a new baby to your list of mothers who waned an abortion but mistakenly wandered ino your ""clinic"" and was assured that they would receive all the help they could possibly need.     I can go ino this further if you wish.However empathic you and  others are about the children of  your own kind quite frankly pro-life posts indicate that nobody  gives a **** about the already born children of women making the decision to get abortions.  I'd be glad to read any post you can find from a pro-lifer that shows one drop of human kindness toward the 75% of the pregnan women and their families living at or below the poverty line that are facing deeper maybe even permanen poverty status if a a child or  additional child is brought ino the family situationIs this GDVikin's line that caused you to call him an idiot?  ""Oh if it's not breathing it's not alive, and every miscarriage/abortion is God's will. He obviously did not wan that thing to become alive...""   I left it out because it's sarcasm.  I had no idea you took that seriously.

If you were taught anything about female puberty in school, you know girls can get pregnan when they are in fifth grade.

Mashmon,"Lou Holt' Speech:  ""Biden and Others Who Support Abortion Are Catholics In Name Only"". [W:111Lou Holtz calls Joe Biden'Catholic in name only' during RNC speechxe2x80x9cOne of the importan reasons [Presiden Donald Trump] has my trust is because nobody is but a stronger advocate for the unborn than Presiden Trump,xe2x80x9d Holtz said.xe2x80x9cThe Biden-Harris ticket is the most radically pro-abortion campaign in history. They and other politicians are Catholics in name only and abandon inocen lives. Presiden Trump protects those lives. I trust Presiden Trump.xe2x80x9dHoltz led ino his line about trust in Trump by citing his time at Notre Dame and the fact that therexe2x80x99s a statue of him at the school.Holt' speech was devastatingly effective.   The leftwing media is desperately trying to couner the message by  immediately troting out James Martin leftwing so-called priest to slam Holtz.  Martin in the past has been highly critical of Trump,  but lets Biden slide on the abortion issue.   Left-leaning Notre Dame also distanced itself from Holtz,  when they should be defending him, or at least commening that Biden's abortion stance is reprehensible.  But they don't.  And that is a disgrace. The  media is also pushing the meme that  Biden a'devout Catholic', which is an insult to devout Catholics.  When someone actively works against the foundational pillar of on's faith, respect for human life,  he not only can't be called'devout', he can't be called'practicin', either.  So Holtz was right on the money when he said Biden and others (say, Pelosi) are Catholics in name only.   They should be denied Holy Communion and threatened with ex-communication, IMHO.  And unless they publicly repen,  they will be judged very severely in the afterlife, IMHO.'Judge not': priest rejects RNC speaker's atack on Biden's faitMy prayer is for Democrats who support abortion to renounce that belief.

Originally I preferred pro-life.  After paying close atenion to my thoughts, I noticed that my moral preferences became a source of bias and they were making my argumens more partial.  My inegrity was compromised because I waned to seek truth for truth sake no mater who benefits.  Originally, I was a fish in water and I was simply doing what I thought was good.  This is what made it hard for me to believe that the pro-life movemen didn't care about saving babies.I tend to focus on good motives of a pro-life person.  They may simply be a fish in water doing what they think is good.  This approach gives me the patience to give longer explanations rather than emphasizing the ill motives. I think is more effective in geting through to them.One thing I wrongly assumed is that people are just ideological and love insulting each other, but there may be more justifications behind what is being said about religion with an alterior motive. Religion has a lot of conformist thinking and it may be exploited to gain massive support.  I will coninue looking through that article you sen tomorrow.

Religious conservative ani-abortion advocates would rather you didn't know about it.  They would like you to think of abortion providers as slavering monsters of evil.   They have gone to great length to obscure the fact that doctors simply don't do abortions on viable, healthy, genetically sound fetuses after the 20th week, unless the mother is going to die or the fetus is grossly  malformed and canot sustain life.     It's not ethical and if they should do an abortion after that time there is a mounain of paperwork to fill out justifying and documening the abortion.  What ani--abortion people refuse to acknowledge is that 99.9% of American doctors are inelligen, ethical, responsible, practical professionals skilled at what they do and make quite a good living doing it.  None of them is going to jeopardize their life or their  license to practice by doing something stupid, illegal, unethical irresponsible, unprofessional and impractical as performing illegal abortions.  Only one doctor has tried  it, Dr. Gosnell.  He is in jail awaiting life senencing or execution (I forget whichAs for staying out of the discussion, don't do that.  The abortion issue effects everyone.  At the core of the Christian rights ani-abortion position is denial of the right to make personal decisions about defining who we are as persons.

First, they must prove that that life is worth protecting; and second, that bodily autonomy is not paramoun to our society and laws.The life argumen is irrelevan. It can be diluted down to insanity.Let's assume for a momen abortion is made illegal, 100%. We know a plurality of conceptions ends in miscarriage. This is undisputed scienific fact. Now, in this dystopian society, let's assume that there is a diet in this dystopian society, they discover a diet that absolutely increases the likelihood a pregnancy is carried to term. In this society, logic follows, women can be imprisoned for negligen murder of a miscarried baby, for refusing to use this dietAdditionally, since we know sperm are a form of life, men could also be penalized and jailed for masturbation. Of course, this expulsion of life, and, by all reasonable standards, mass murder of human life, is a necessary function of the male body; if a male does not ejaculate for a long period of time, the body actively expunges those sperm via nocturnal emissions. This in turn dismisses the argumen that life is something inherenly worth saving, if our bodies are designed to expunge life on a mass scale every few weeks.But let's get beyond that, and look at the most importan moral imperative: Bodily Autonomy.I am going to argue that Bodily Autonomy is the basis for all of our rights, and as such, bodily autonomy must be protected at all costs.For this, I am going to display two scenarios for you, with the same protagonistBecky. Becky is a 24 year old college girl at a party. While at the party, Becky grinds up on Steve. Steve turns Becky on, Becky decides to join Steve in the bathroom.

She also knows if she has sex, she can get pregnanWhile laying on the sidewalk, Becky is approached by an EMT, who says to her, unequivocally, the man in the other car is going to die unless Becky agrees to a blood transfusionThanks to bodily autonomy - Becky can, and in this scenario, indeed does, say no. The other party dies.Becky canot be penalized for this. She canot be fined, nor jailed. She canot be penalized for exercising her right to bodily autonomy. She can indeed be penalized for runing the red light. She can be fined, she can have her license suspended. But she canot be penalized for exercising her right to bodily autonomy.In the scenario of her pregnancy, Becky is under no legal obligation to provide her body to the enity inside her, and thus, can absolutely act to abort the pregnancy. Our moral imperative in this situation indeed is to protect her right to bodily autonomy. She can't be penalized for ****ing Steve, although pleny of right wing fascists would love to criminalize sex outside of marriage, they just don't wan to admit that's the end goal.Now - to those who wan to dispute her right to abort, if we end the protection for bodily autonomy, imagine this scenario.Rob passes out at the mall due to a panic atack.

Conaeolos,"Blue Donkey saidDo you believe abortion is only a women's rights issue? Why or why notClick to expand...Generally no, but there are specific situations which would qualify.Women's rights issues are strictly situations where women are not recognized in their full personhood/citizenship/etc.I think for the sake of ease in casual discussion one may at times expand this term to view issues importan to women(e.g. abortion), or predominately related to women(e.g. childcare in the workplace), or gender-specific (e.g. women's sports); but, to actually classify with such broad circumstances,  promotes one to under-accoun for the many stakeholders involved in all those broader, perhaps beter termed'women's issues'.A women's rights issue really comes down to if something meets a threshold of'equality before the law'. So for example, and as related to this topic. In Roe v Wade. The laws at issue: Articles 1191-1194 and 1196 of the Texas Penal Code (1961). Provided only one exception to giving birth: ""procured or atempted by medical advice"".I thin'abortion restriction' in that narrow conext meets the threshold of not viewing women as equal before the law.No person should require a doctor to be of the ""purpose of saving the life(inc quality) of the mother.It thus seems to me, this law diminished a women's capacity to known when these purposes fit her circumstances, which is plainly a women's rights issue.In that narrow case, I can be seen as pro-choice. As I do acknowledge a fundamenal injustice and sexism.Ener, a more common example of questions surrounding abortion & abortion restrictions. Planed Parenhood v. Casey / Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. Law at issue: Pensylvania Abortion Conrol Act(1982) & Texas House Bill 2.Neither was well-writen legislation or ""good laws"" in opinion as both are examples of big governmen, unenforceable[with consistency], sounding arbitrary and overly punitive. That said, most laws are drafted terribly IMHO. To get back to the poin, and skipping the legal argumen, is the fundamenal argumen made by the court: ""these laws create an undue burden on the constitutionally protected right of women to abort based on viability"" a win on a women's rights issues?Not in the slightest! Most people do not by law get to unilaterally issue decrees involving many parties (e.g. parens, husbands, community) just because they are at the cenre, especially when those choices which have deep moral consequences and far-reaching impacts(e.g. killing the next Steve jobs); including societal (e.g. due to disproportionate black abortion, black are significanly lower in our population directly due to higher abortion). The couner-argumen here, of course, being: ""her body, her choice.A nice saying to be sure, but an oversimplified one. The senimen here is an example of a privilege(legally promised) being upheld at the cost of equal rights of all the other stakeholders. It is by my view the exact opposite of what'women's right' seeks; violating the moral argumens of which that noble principle stands.Thus I say broadly, no abortion and abortion restrictions involve many considerations and are far too broad a topic to simply be mostly about woman's rights. That said: certain laws, opinions and conexts are directly women's rights. Women have the capacity and responsibility to make moral health choices, wherein the considerations and protections for potenial life dismiss that inherit truth, so in does abortion becomes as simple as giving back women their god-given rights and recognizing them as equal before the law.",47,Male,,Conservative,0.44162294861447404,0.07449219800914715

Separation of church and state and all that says otherwise.Click to expand...You're right. The abortion question is 100% a 1st amendmen issue and nothing else.Two strong religious organizations have tenets that require women give birth if they get pregnan whether they wan to be pregnan or not. The Constitution protects the right of the Catholics and the sects that fall under the evangelical heading to believe what ever suits them and their God.  Nobody is trying to take away their rights or their  freedom to believe.  They are not victims.There isn't actually  problem about what these two churches believe.Unil the Church and the evangelicals start start geting Congress or the states to  pass laws that force their religious beliefs on all women not just their own.  Every law they pass restricting abortion violates the command that  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishmen of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;"".    They are clearly asking governmen establish their religious laws above all other.    They keep the focus on the fetus and the personhood of the fetus to deflect from their  church and state  violationThe issue is; does a church have the right to make those outside their religious group honor follow their religious dogma.Our fragile democracy rests on that 1st Amendmen .

There are a lot of bad things that have ""always existed"" and if this is your moral case for abortion, ani-abortionists will have a very easy time to refute you. This too is completely irrelevan to the mater.Yet another poor case. Come on. As a defender of abortion you should be beter!The reason abortion should be legal is not down to ""subjective preference"", it is rather down to the universal and objective truth that is individual rights. Calling it ""subjective"" is handing your opponen a huge advanage.Completely irrelevan. Emphasising this implies that you would not favour a woman's right to have an abortion had it been as complicated as rocket-science or if abortion was a modern phenomenon that emerged yesterday.How hard and how old it is has nothing to do with anything.Morals and ethics mater. The concept of individual rights are necessary for a society to function in a civilised way. If you wan a barbaric society, you call for ""subjective morals"" and if you wan a rational one, you poin at objective morals.A woman has the right to get an abortion because it is her body. Period.Click to expand... I was trying  explain why any  discussion about conrolling  abortion  had to be factual and defendable.  Agreemen or compromise  comes from facts not feelings or opinions or morals.A statemen that  abortions should stop because they are immoral just starts a  ""yes it will , no it won't ""  Merry-go -Round of disagreemens.  Abortion can not be stopped by declaring it immoral. historical records History of abortion - Wikipedia  show that it is impossible to suppress the  information  or the administering of  herbal and mechanical abortions and  women will abort in spite of  the law, the morals, the punishmen or the consequences.  So, a discussion based on  morality will not accomplish a goal of making laws that conrol abortion because by both women and providers ignore the morality.",51,,Oregon,,0.49451286261631094,0.0670032840722496
OceanBlues1,"soylengreen saidThe abortion threads on this site including this one, mostly all suffer the same problem of looking at the tree and not seeing the forestIn this case you have left out the one vital , absolutely necessary elemen in an abortion discussion.  Which is that of the place of women in society.Some here make a big deal over the constitutional rights and claim the law is on their side. They give no consideration to the fact that the laws and inerpretation of the constitution still in america,  lean to a christian perspective.  And the christian perspective is still that of women are second class people who should, by gods command, be obedien to men.  That the purpose of a women is to birth children for their man.  Any inerests she may have, any career she may hold any other purpose she may decide on is thrown away if she becomes pregnan.  Because a women is only judged by her ability to give birth.How many  threads on abortion here where women have not been called names such as slut, evil, immoral, selfish and not capable of rational decisions.  Most of the pro lifers here do fall ino the category of having demonised women for their choices.These argumens on abortion will always keep reappearing in america because women have never really been considered the equal of a manClick to expand...I agree on all poins.

Information is kept confidenial.It isn't and the SC  ruled they did not have to follow the confidenially regulation of medical ceners if they were not officially medical clinics.2. Financial help is provided for pregnancy and baby. There is no  financial help with pre or post natal care or  birthing, well baby clinics,  mother's postpartum costs,  follow up medical visits.  The ceners offer free diapers and formula for some limited time.3. School nurse and health ceners can't help you if you are pregnanThese are exactly the places to go first for information and help.4. Abortion is dangerous,causes breast cancer,  infertility and permanen depression. This is simply not true.5. They are a medical clinic staffed by nurses and doctors.Most of the Catholic CPC have gone through a ""conversion process""  and managed to get classified as actual medical clinics. In spite of this official designation they do not provide actual professional medical services except for their ultrasound.  Their limited ultrasound program is overseen by an off site medical or osteopathic doctor. Somehow this makes them qualified to call themselves a medical clinic.   STD testing is still done by voluneers but records have to be kept and the  overseen again by an off site nurse.After the sonogram exam  is finished a voluneer counselor goes over the pictures using an inappropriate and unprofessional  Church designed dialogue  stressing the  inocence and helplessness of the fetus, encouraging the  bonding between mother and fetus and emphasizing the horrors of abortion.  It's ironic the CPC needs to have this professional ultrasound to qualify as a medical clinic then it uses that exam  in a way that is totally unethical for a medical clinic.If the CPC has not converted to a medical clinic it is free to dress up it's voluneers in white coats and surgical scrubs and play doctor.  The SC says it can do this and it doesn't have to notify the patien it is not a medical cener and the staff are not medical professionals.",52,,Oregon,,0.18206605222734254,0.05748847926267282

Do you idenify yourself more pro-life or pro-choice? Why?I lean more Pro-choice because I think it's the lesser evil than giving the state the power to effectively own and conrol what women do with their bodies.2. Do you ever consider a fetus(et al) a life, under what conditions? Why or why notYes. I think using birth as a line for determining person-hood is prety arbitrary.3. What is a fair level of input by the mother verses the law on the issue of abortion? Why?The law creates a stable legal framework for individuals to make their own decisions.4. Do you only consider abortion a women's only issue? Why?No. I think men are affected by abortion as parters and ideally, a couple should make a decision between them to see if they can raise a child together.5. Do you consider the act of abortion morally wrong? Under what standard? Why?Yes and no. Abortion requires an act of conscience on the value of life and our ability to bring a life in to existence but that belongs to the individual and not the state.6. Do you consider laws which restrict access to abortion morally wrong? Under what standard? Why?It's depends. I'd have to get more specific and research it honestly.7. Do you consider people who discourage abortion morally wrong? Under what standard? Why?No. If you simply discourage abortion and weigh in on the moral argumens as a concerned friend, that's fine. trying to compel people either by the law or some kind of harassmen or violence against doctors or abortion clinics is wrong though. I can still see why people do it if they think the lives of the unborn are being lost because of it though.8. Do you consider people who encoruge abortion morally wrong? Under what standard? Why?If someone cheapens the life on the unborn, it's definitely going to bother me.9. What do you view as the core moral failing of the opposite moral argumen? I.E. Why do you not hold itThe state doesn't own people as property and hence can't use law to dictate what they can or canot do.10. Is most killing a form of murder? Why or why notYes. Thought some killing maybe justified, such as in war or self-defence. But it remains murder as the taking of a life.11. What is the greater moral good, what's in the best inerests of the'individual' or what is in the best inerests of'societ'?It's a bit of both. Societies and individuals aren't mutually exclusive. But I'd lean more towards individual rights to preven abuses of power.12. What is the greater moral good, what's in the best inerests of the above choice or what is in the best inerests of the'family'?If individuals consen to do what is in the inerests of their family based on their free will, that is ok. But you shouldn't force someone to do that, because that's an abusive relationship. Some people like power play in the bedroom but only when it's consensual.

MrWonka,"Conaeolos said1. Do you idenify yourself more pro-life or pro-choice? Why?Click to expand...Choice, because I understand that a woman's body belongs to her an nobody else. It canot be occupied by any person living or not. Just as no person can ener your house without permission no one can take over your body.Conaeolos said2.

What is a fair level of input by the mother verses the law on the issue of abortion? Why?Click to expand...Unil such a time as the governmen could conceivably take over the care of a child from the mother, all decisions are 100% the purview of the mother.Even after that poin, the mother has every right to have the fetus removed from her body.Conaeolos said4. Do you only consider abortion a women's only issue?

Conaeolos,"Kyle Phoenix saidI only just realised this was mean to agree questions but I just waned to get stuck right in! :mrgreenClick to expand...:lol: well, it's already seeming to be a nonstarter. Not that I am overly surprised. It is hard to take such emotional argumens in the affirmative, so much of our shadow fears geting ino the light. I must thank you and MrWonka for showing a proof of concept. And I am impressed by both at your ability to keep it so short, as I am sure you both could have expanded on each question a lot as others have well poined outI figure I should in the least now provide mine (atempting to keep brevity) for if nothing more curiosity sake.1. Do you idenify yourself more pro-life or pro-choice? Why?Lean pro-life, although I am really indifferen politically. The underlying moral question will always result in vastly differen positions by good moral people. What I am sure is these types of questions are always best put to democracy never the court. A court requiring the appearance of objectivity and universal consistency. Democracy meanwhile always being arbitrary and checked rather by consensus with the people than seeking imperfectly to some higher justice like a court system should as a whole.2. Do you ever consider a fetus(et al) a life, under what conditions? Why or why notMy reasoning is enirely religious, but yes early in the second trimester, a fetus is ensouled. I think the fact nature has so many natural miscarriages before that critical poin, it's clear the potenial life is in the stage of a vessel rather than a human soul.3. What is a fair level of input by the mother verses the law on the issue of abortion? Why?Some. I for example hate with a fiery passion of 1000 suns, how the governmen can mandate masks for the 1:1000000 chance I could spread a virus I may or may not have. End of the day though, my'right to make my own choice' does carry impact and this conflict falls ino a legal grey zone. A mothers choice in an abortion is not differen. We democratically may decide, rightly or wrongly, to restrict absolute freedom, but just as I am considered (there are criterias for exception) in mask laws, a mother is considered in all but the most tyranical abortion legislation. That's really is all one can ask in a civilized society. Both the right to democratically check the laws. And the right for your individual rights & freedoms to be considered in their drafting.4. Do you only consider abortion a women's only issue? Why?No that seems absurd from my POV. People are impacted in differen ways. For example, many people in my life were potenially aborted had circumstances been differen with informs my personal views. That experience shouldn't be void as a consideration because some people have a ""radical right to freedom""? Maybe if we in most cases we faced with impactful choices that legally were seen as inherit free choices (anarco-captialism).  I don't advocate for that system being moral in general, so its even less so as a moral appeal in this specific case.5. Do you consider the act of abortion morally wrong? Under what standard? Why?Sure, but at the discretion of a judge that sees a conext far greater than I am capable as it relates to inen, which I have no method of geting to know in 99.9999% of cases.6. Do you consider laws which restrict access to abortion morally wrong? Under what standard? Why?No. I acknowledge they can get to the poin of tyranical, but last I checked,  if a sizeable amoun of people feel that way they could reform the law. What about the tyrany of the majority? That happens all the time, the concept is a guideline to promote humility, not a rule. Anyone is welcome to live in the community which best protects their inerests, just like with the majority of issues of abuse by tyrany of the majority. I'd certianly revisit if those freedoms are also restricted. When you have any type of size to your minority,'tyrany of the majorit' remains far less of a threat than plain old tyrany, with a small group legislating against the majority for a postion likely'in name only' the far bigger concern for me.7. Do you consider people who discourage abortion morally wrong? Under what standard? Why?No their motives seem clear, but they can certainly seem extremely judgemenal, rude and insensitive. So neither am I surprised to see them seen in a bad light nor am I particularly happy to see them making organizations and making a big fuss.",58,Male,,Conservative,0.5377147525676935,0.12591100076394196
Conaeolos,"8. Do you consider people who encourage abortion morally wrong? Under what standard? Why?Much of the time. Not by way of their personal stance, rather their motives to voice their opinions reek of emotional projection. It is one thing, to say something like ""look, people get abortions, if that's your choice. I support you. heck if I were you I'd do it"" or a potenial father voicing ""you should abort"". Those are the same kind of things, you often hear about'epidurals' since there is so much judgemen around them. Abortion is a judgemenal issue too.  So sure, make your couner-opinion known. Great - that's being human.  Advocating past that, which I believe more common. Pure and uter projection and devoid of moral consideration.  So yes the mothers-mother who says ""abort it"" is commiting sin, but not with softer expression. Encouragemen needing to be a more willful act, not a passive expression of opinion which may or may not influence someone.9.What do you view as the core moral failing of the opposite moral argumen? I.E. Why do you not hold itLack of a belief in the concept of God. That is, lack of acknowledgemen of a higher-power, even if that higher power isn't a being/thing but a man-made conceptTo use catholic terminology (and no I am not catholic): the sin of abortion isn't murder it's pride. All lives are in the hands of fate, the moral question is not was our act justified, but is our inenion selfish or based in due consideration. A personal question, no doubt. And why judgemen although common, isn't really necessary when  it comes to the act itself.10. Is most killing a form of murder? Why or why notRarely. Death is an extension of enhropy. Chaos an aspect of our nature. Killing a natural human impulse, whenever our influences fails to achieve our inen, we crave force, and such forceful acts can affect another person/soul. Killing is most often reckless disregard or compelled by defensive impulse. The'sin of murder' is all in the inenion, can you see and feel the humanity you take? Do you do so for'ego-juice' or'necessarily'? Inenion not act defines ones morality.11. What is the greater moral good, what's in the best inerests of the'individual' or what is in the best inerests of'societ'?For society, it is beter what is right for the individual. For the individual, it is beter what is right for society.When an individual does what best for the individual at the cost of the society. They are acting immorally.When a society does what is right for society at the cost of individuals. They are acting immorally.12. What is the greater moral good, what's in the best inerests of the above choice or what is in the best inerests of the'family'?No, I reject any ethic deriving from biological family. e.g. Biblical(OT) ethic. If we are talkin'spiritual family' rather than biological, that follows the above paradigm's model.",58,Male,,Conservative,0.4085485606672047,0.18426150121065374

Amazing huh?So how does one logically and realistically reduce unwaned pregnancy?   <--- There is the crux to the whole abortion debat1) honest and real sex-education starting BEFORE puberty sets in2) no more ""abstinence only"" nonsense3) birth conrol - education about it, affordable, free, covered by health insurance, easier access to it4) health care - affordable, covered by health insurance, easy access, free for lower income/unemployed5) stop shaming and demeaning women when it comes to sex6) stop insisting sex should only be for procreationThat's the best place to startWhile it's never going to be possible to 100% eliminate all abortions from happening, what can be done is to drastically reduce the number down to almost nothing that isn't a medical necessity or due to rape/incest type scenarios.That's what most are really talking about anyway.Trying to preven abortions after conception will not work.The goal should be prevening conception, in as many instances as possible, unless conception is actually the goal.So the question is, if you're pro-life (or ani-abortion) from the legal poin of view, are you actually willing to commit to working towards an honest solution or not?  Are you willing to work towards the prevenion of unwaned pregnancies rather than the outlawing of something that won't change the outcome in the long runTo preven abortions, you must preven unwaned/unplaned pregnancies.Are you willing to work towards that goal or notFootote : sex-shaming females isn't the path forward regarding any of this either - don't go down that patClick to expand...Maybe we should educate the dairy farmers not to give away the milk unless someone buys the cow?",60,Male,,,0.5611111111111111,0.2775793650793651

Since 1974, the age-standardized abortion rate per 1,000 married women aged 15 to 44 almost doubled from 6.6 to 11.2. For most of these women, it was their first abortion, and the majority had taken at least one pregnancy to term.Marital status and abortion.  - PubMed - NCBINational Institute of health investigation",60,Male,"Meridian, Idaho",Cenrist,0.4011671335200747,0.12324929971988796

Do you fully understand how women feel when they are pregnan with potenial offspring that have only a 1/3 chance of being bornClick to expand...Let me preface my response with a declaration of my positions. First that I am Pro-Choice as shown by my record in this Forum. Second that I am also well-aware of the biological process which informs my opinions on which phases of said process allow for such a choice, and which should notI am also on record as to my opinion about arguing on's feelings, as opposed to rational thoughtSo I am not going to argue either emotion or religion. I do argue for both individual responsibility and also individual rights.As to individual responsibility? Individuals are responsible for their actions. The should take measures so that they do not find themselves is such situation, but if they do they must be responsible for making the right choice.There is a Caveat: Individual Rights. Such rights can be limited by society under the rule of law to protect the lives and property of others.Thus as to rights? It is my opinion that a woman has absolute rights to conrol over their own bodies, as do men. But they also have to recognize the rights of others, and in our society one of those is the right to life.Therefore, I hold that it should be the woman's choice to abort at any time prior to the poin where the developing fetus can be legally determined a ""person"" (human being). But at the poin in it's developmen it is determined to be a ""person,"" he/she should be accorded the same rights and protections as any other individual absen risk to the life of the mother.Now an argumen can be made regarding ""at what poin this shift occurs,"" and that is a differen segmen of the discussion. But that is not about whether a woman has a right to abort or not, as I say she does.  No, it is when this choice has become one between removing an ""unwaned growth,"" and the ""killing of an unwaned child.To poin out the extreme; One could argue that since the ""growth"" took place inside a woman, why would a choice to ""abort it"" end just because it is born? After all, it remains a ""burden"" to the woman thereafter unless she can find some other way to get rid of itWe know this is not a valid way of viewing the situation, as even the most extreme view allows for the declaration of ""humanity"" when the child is born. How then must we assume that right up UNTIL it is actually born, it remains disposable?So while I argue a woman has the right to choose, it has a ""time limit"" before it cedes to the right of the unborn ""child"" to life.",64,Male,Mid-West USA,Libertarian - Left,0.44380341880341884,0.05659340659340659

""But those decisions created the right to abortion out of whole cloth, without a shred of support from the Constitutionxe2x80x99s text.

This Court created the right to abortion based on an amorphous, unwriten right to privacy, which it grounded in the'legal fiction' of substanive due process.Thomas further called Roe v.

Josie,"Blue Donkey said""Saving lives"" obviously refers to the girls and women who suffer potenially fatal gynecological diseases, some of which are not caused by pregnancy. Only abortions themselves, which are a relatively small part of Planed Parenhood's budget, canot receive federal funding. So if the governmen totally defunded Planed Parenhood, many women would die whether they are pregnan or notClick to expand...'m sorry -- are you under the impression that Planed Parenhood is the only way for women to get medical care?Why do you throw race ino this? I am a big fan of Black Lives Mater. Whether an offspring should exist or not depends on what the mother (and sometimes the father) waned, nobody else. She needs to wan a baby and be able to take care of one when it happens  no mater what her race is. Otherwise, she must have the right to choose whether to coninue her pregnancy and give him/her up or end it early because it is her body, her life, her choice.Click to expand...Because, just like emotions, race can't be eliminated from the topic.  So only born black lives mater.  RightEmotions always run higher on the ""pro-life"" side. They choose to ignore all the facts and let emotions dictate their biased opinions.Click to expand...Yes, emotions are always higher on the pro-life side because we DON'T ignore the facts.  We know a ZEF is a human and we find it abhorren that some people think those humans are property to be tossed away like trash.Pro-choicers OTOH base their emotions on the facts. Have you ever noticed pro-choicers not only talk about sociology, finances, obstetrics, and more, but support their claims by posting website links? But every time so-called ""pro-lifers"" are asked to do the same, all they do is dodge the issue, doing their best to avoid admiting they are wrong. If pro-lifers were right about anything and using facts to form their opinions and emotions, they would prove all pro-choicers wrong about everything.Click to expand...Incorrect.  Pro-choicers atempt to eliminate emotion from the conversation enirely.  When bringing up biological facts about fetal developmen, pro-choicers say you can't do that because it's an ""emotional plea.""  If I say that a 14-week gestation fetus has eyes, arms, legs, fingers, toes, pro-choicers don't wan to hear it -- it's an ""emotional plea.""  Hell yeah it's emotional.  It's a HUMAN - a CHILD- a litle baby.  Pro-choicers don't wan to think about a fetus having arms, legs, fingers, toes, eyes -- they wan to pretend that it's just a blob so that they don't feel that natural emotion.  Pro-choicers almost never admit that a ZEF is a human.  They say a ZEF is just a ""clump of cells,"" ""like a tumor,"" ""parasite"" or just a part of the mother's body when everyone who wen through 5th grade health class know that's not true.",72,Female,,Libertarian - Right,0.5412698412698413,0.04126984126984126

United States (1910In a case from the Philippines, the Supreme Court finds that the definition of ""cruel and unusual punishmen"" is not limited to what the authors of the Constitution understood under that conceptMeyer v. Nebraska (1923A case ruling that parens may decide for themselves if and when their children may learn a foreign language, based upon a fundamenal liberty inerest individuals have in the family unitPierce v. Society of Sisters (1925A case deciding that parens may not be forced to send their children to public rather than private schools, based on the idea that, once again, parens have a fundamenal liberty in deciding what happens to their childrenOlmstead v. United States (1928The court decides that wire tapping is legal, no mater what the reason or motivation, because it is not expressly prohibited in the Constitution. Justice Brandeis' dissen, however, lays the groundwork for future understandings of privacy.Skiner v. Oklahoma (1942An Oklahoma law providing for the sterilization of people found to be ""habitual criminals"" is struck down, based on idea that all people have a fundamenal right to make their own choices about marriage and procreationTileston v. Ullman (1943) & Poe v. Ullman (1961The Court refuses to hear a case on Conecticut laws prohibiting the sale of conraceptives because no one can demonstrate they have been harmed. Harlan's dissen in Poe, however, explains why the case should be reviewed and why fundamenal privacy inerests are at stake.Griswold v. Conecticut (1965Conecticut's laws against distribution of conraceptives and conraceptive information to married couples are struck down, with the Court relying on earlier preceden involving the rights of people to make decisions about their families and procreation as a legitimate sphere of privacy.Loving v. Virginia (1967Virginia law against inerracial marriages is struck down, with the Court once again declaring that marriage is a ""fundamenal civil right"" and that decisions in this arena are not those with which the State can inerefere unless they have good cause.Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972The right of people to have and know about conraceptives is expanded to unmarried couples, because the right of people to make such decisions exists due not simply to the nature of the marriage relationship. Instead, it is also due to the fact that it is individuals making these decisions, and as such the governmen has no business making it for them, regardless of their marital status.Roe v. Wade (1973The landmark decision which established that women have a basic right to have an abortion, this was based in many ways upon the earlier decisions above.

It's awful that many Debate Politics members have very litle or no understanding of what these two subjects mean for the morality of women's human and legal rights to have abortions.Before you try to criticize pro-choicers on the forum, please think carefully about the followin1. The word ""born"" id explicit is in the 14th Ame4ndmen. This word alone permanenly prevens all zygotes, blastocysts, embryos, and fetuses from having the legal right to life. Therefore, abortion can never be illegal in America.2. The same amendmen and several others guaranee every American citizen, including pregnan girls and women, has the human rights to privacy, bodily autonomy, and lifestyle choices like whether to have kids or another kid.3. When a girl or woman is pregnan, she probably gets sick every morning (throwing up and feeling pain), feels fatigued every afternoon, can't function normally, takes time off work, and is at risk of geting severe complications.4. Unil sometime during the third trimester, an unborn offspring is not able to think or perceive anything so it canot suffer during an elective abortion because they never happen that late - almost all abortions happen very early.5. A human being is not viable unil normal breathing, drinking, digestion, circulation, sleep/wake cycle, and volunary movemen fully independen of the mom or technology have been occurring, not at a certain time in gestationIf I am wrong about anything, pro-lifers are able to prove it. If you try to prove it and can't, you are a liar.

Killing human life is exactly that.  Don't feel the need to prove anything to you or any other abortionist.  It's like arguing with my dog or the dirty dish pile.  I know killing when I see it.

Additionally, over 50 percen of the surveyed women kept their abortions secret from their church community. Roughly two thirds of the women surveyed said their pastorxe2x80x99s teachings on forgiveness did not apply to them, and over half  believed that their church is out-of-touch when it comes to helping women understand their options when facing an unplaned pregnancy.",76,,Oregon,,0.47816666666666663,0.08516666666666665

On top of that medicare tends to have a lot of restrictions and hoops to jump through to stay enrolled, which also reduces access.  Many forms of BC require health insurance to be affordable, with the exception of things like condoms.Any form of birth conrol that is ""automatic"", meaning its effective if you do not have to stop in the heat of the momen to put on a condom or something, is going to be more effective due to human nature in general, which is often emotion based.After you consider that, its just common sense.  If there is a group of people who are not well off, they will look at the cost of an abortion vs the cost of raising a child and make that economic decision.

Although today bioethics is dominated by other issues that are perceived as more pressing, the answer to the philosophical question lurking behind abortionxe2x80x94Who and what are we?xe2x80x94turns out to be the key that unlocks the ethical quandaries posed by these other issues. After all, if human persons ought not to be either subjects of research or killed without justification, and if the fetus from conception is a human person,[1] then embryo experimenation, abortion, and cloning[2] are prima facie morally wrong.We have seen that the atempt to either sidestep the issue of personhood or to make a distinction between human beings and human persons fails. Concerning the later, we have seen that because the functions of personhood are grounded in the essenial nature of humaness, and because human beings are persons that mainain idenity through time from the momen they come ino existence, it follows that the unborn are human persons of great worth because they possess that nature as long as they existNo doubt much more can be said about the problem of what constitutes personhood,[25] but what is importan to understand is that personhood criteria are riddled with serious problems and that the prolife advocate has been given no compelling reason to abandon her belief that the unborn are full-fledged members of the human community.Abortion, Bioethics, and Personhood: A Philosophical Reflection | The Cener for Bioethics & Human Dignit",82,Male,New York Cit,Independen,0.32137096774193546,0.02836021505376344

If there is a significan discrepancy between these Great Goals, then you will never honestly agree.I suppose this is more of a general note on the ethics debates, but it is certainly relevan to your case.Click to expand...Would that more posts like yours, Triton, make it ino this thread/ A very thoughtful posts indeed.

Demoness,"This is obvious, but for the sake of clarity: My claim is that it is morally permissible for a woman to have an abortion, even if it is not medically necessary. People have a desire to be alive as opposed to dead & an aversion to harm. This is demonstrable even in infans, but the same is not always so for zefs. Fetuses do respond to stimuli. However, the poin at which fetuses can feel pain is irrelevan on the topic of whether it is immoral to abort them at all or not becauseA) They rely enirely on the motherxe2x80x99s body, which can significanly impact her physically & financially in a negative way.B) The ability to sense pain alone is not indicative of a will to live. Some people have a disorder called congenial analgesia, which inhibits their ability to feel pain. But these people still try to avoid harm coming to their bodies, & they aren't apathetic about life merely due to a lack of physical pain. What more, pain in fetuses during abortions can be mitigated if not eliminated by improved medical practices.A fetus is completely relian on the motherxe2x80x99s body to survive, it is a parasitic relationship by definition. Those who have already been born are not parasitic in this way, so there is no issue of prioritizing one personxe2x80x99s life & well-being over anotherxe2x80x99s. Itxe2x80x99s impossible to value both lives equally; you either value the life & well-being of the fetus over the mother, or the mother over the fetus. Unlike the fetus, the mother is conscious. She has a will whereas the fetus does not, & that is at the core of why we value what the born wan over the unborn. A woman does not owe the fetus a life at the cost of her health, livelihood, & potenially her life -- but it is virtuous if she grans itWe are not morally obligated to allow anything to live solely because it is alive, even if such an organism has human DNA & diploid cells, & even if said organism has the potenial to one day be conscious, enabling them to have an aversion to harm & the will to live. We are even morally justified in taking the lives of born people if they endanger the lives of inocen people (& there is no other solution, like therapy. No, I'm not enirely for capital punishmen. Differen can of worms, though).Side note that yes, I am inenionally avoiding the usage of the wordsxe2x80x9cbabyxe2x80x9d orxe2x80x9cchildxe2x80x9d in place ofxe2x80x9cfetusxe2x80x9d because I find it dishonest; people immediately imagine infans & not fetuses/embryos when those terms are used.

Donation is giving freely, not charging  money.  Planed Parenhood lied because they knew what they were doing was both illegal and immoral.The reason selling aborted baby parts is and should be illegal is it can encourage the promotion of abortion for the purpose of harvesting those parts.

roguenuke,"I don say this. I think anyone should express their opinion and the merits or lack of should be discussed.On a personal level, I think it is importan for two people in a commited relationship to discuss abortion and their views on whether they would have one/approve of having one, under what circumstances, probably before geting to having children or even sex would be best (although that is very likely asking a lot for most people). It is importan though for at least those who are married or going to be because there are situations that could lead to problems with the marriage when it comes to differing views on abortion. If one spouse is absolutely prolife regardless of circumstances and the other believes at least in exceptions for rape, then a woman in the relationship being raped (doesn't mater if the person not raped is a man or woman, nor which is prolife w/o exception) and geting pregnan could end the relationship, causing more emotional damage/hardship to both because of those views on whatever she chooses. It should still be her choice but it is beter to know the position of the person you are in a relationship with to determine if that is worth the risk before it even happens.Ultimately though, the fact still remains that the legality of it affects women's rights mainly (at the momen) because only women get pregnan (for now) and their bodily autonomy would far exceed any rights of a man to a potenial child.

Piglet,"Scrabaholic saidAn overwhelming majority of women who get an abortion do not regret the decision to undergo the procedure, according to a new study published in the academic journal Social Science & Medicine on Sunday.Researchers surveyed 667 women across 21 states in the US multiple times over a five-year period, tracking each womanxe2x80x99s emotions around their decision to get an abortion. About 95% of women indicated they believe that going through an abortion was the right decision over the course of the study.The study asked participans if they had any emotions of sadness, guilt, relief, regret, anger or happiness over their decision. Relief was the most common emotion throughout the five years of the study.Most women do not regret having an abortion, study finds | World news | The GuardianAnd here we have yet another study showing that the vast majority of women who abort do not regret it.

I will not assume I know everyting, but can explain the logic behind it. Please take your time thinking about the facts that are posted to beter understand the issues.First of all, girls can get pregnan before  they sex education begins at schools. It happens to fifth graders. They don't even know their own reproductive systems yet. Even in middle school, kids don't know anything about conraception. Yet they can stillt be raped at those young ages. For some weird reason, pro-lifers are the same people who strongly oppose starting sex education before high school - years after many girls start having periods, but years before they can do anything else. See the problem there?Second, not all states require sex education at every elemenary, middle, and high school anyway. Without a federal mandate, there is no way every child is going to learn about conraception and abstience. That is just a cold hard fact. Telling people they can simply use conraception or refrain from having sex is totally meaningless unil a federal law passes to make sex education mandatory at all three levels except for religious schools, which are usually Catholic.Third, even women who do know about conraception and abstinence can't avoid geting raped. Obviously there is no way any girl or woman can know when she could meet a rapist. Unless she is married, her knowledge about conraception and abstinence is useless in hat situation. So it is always immoral to force anyone who was impregnaned by rape to carry her unwaned embryo/fetus to term.And don't get me started on the idea that they are all waned just because there is a list of couples who wan to adopt newborns. The reason there are so many kids in foster homes is there are more kids than homes to put them in",98,Female,"Gainesville, Florida",Liberal,0.4248384353741496,0.03672619047619048

Health of the baby and/or that of the mother, not waning to risk the child growing up lost in the foster system, with no stability, fear of what the father will.do of he finds out (it's not unheard of for a bio father to reclaim a child he was not initially told of, or a mother to get back her bio child).If a woman is not financially stable she should not be having unprotected sex and should understand the consequences of her actions, in my opinionClick to expand...Premise failure. There are only three methods that are 100% guaraneed not to ensure no pregnancy; abstenion, removal of the testicles from the male, and removal of the overies from the female. Even vasectomy and tubal ligation are a chance of failure. Any sex without those three conditions risks pregnancy, even if the risk fall to less than 1%. Unless you have data to show that most abortions are for pregnancies resulting from unprotected sex, you are stereotyping.This brings me to my main question...(drum roll please..)

My wife at one time tried to adopt and was rejected for being diabetic. Not to menion the number of same sex couples who would love to adopt and have been rejected.

Well lets correct this right now.  You are confusing what is the law which is not really under debate, with what ought to be the law, which should always be on the table for debate. Roe v Wade is constanly being re-examined as judges explore its boundaries with new generation of jurists having their say to the 1972 decision.    the definitions of murder and homicide are siting in state statutes just like every other crime as legislators add, subtract or reword details in the revised criminal statutes. New crimes defining providing abortion, facilitating abortion, etc can be outside the framework of homicide or murder charges.  They get changed, modified and amended  a hundred times every legislative session. no reason this topic should not excluded from the process.    The question becomes which direction do our represenatives move and how much leeway with SCOTUS provide for them to wiggle in.  And then we have administrative law/ regulations and liability under tort actions outside the criminal purview which also supposedly reflect our changing values and priorities.  No reason Abortion clinics, doctors, and pro life protesters should be immune from those pressures. the mere fact that Roe exists is virtually meaningless when  courts are designed to respond to public pressure over time, and an amendmen process is provided for the enire documen Nothing in this issue is a givenSo now you can add back the law to your long list of debatable topics.",105,Male,Lebanon Oregon,Liberal,0.3713620071684589,-0.01015616999487967

Of course, such an act would be murder/suicide as a result of inernal bleeding, so I can't imagine a woman trying to kill her fetus that way.Nowhere in my first post did I even imply women should have abortions or it is the ""right thing"" just because my morality differs from yours.

No, I thought I was prety clear that the constitutional right to privacy, the foundation of Roe, is not siting in cemen any more than Miranda has cemened a right to have basic civil liberties explained upon arrest.  The Origins and History of the Right to Privacy.   It was described first in a dissens by Justice Brandeis in 1928 and Justice Harlan in 1961.   It got it'majorit' in 1965 under Griswold.  These are all moving targets, that swing in a very very slow deliberate political breeze. As more conservative Presidens and Senators reflect the tastes and opinions of the public in their appoinmens from jurists that reflect a differen cultural bias, so too, these are evenually reflected in these decisions.    That is why it is importan not to let them stick around and pack the courtThe confideniality laws may have an indirect foundation in the notion of'privacy' as a value and priority in our society, but its all a reflection of public policy as directed by statutes, that I fully endorse by the way.   The fourth amendmen has nothing to do with  conaining the business practices of some insurance company or doctors office.  Its just a law like any other.  It could be erased by a simple majority of legislators and a presidenial signature as easily as it arrived.Let me be clear.  I am not proposing any changes either in the inerpretation or application of this right of privacy as a constitutional doctrine, or Roe, or even public policy in statutes.  I am saying that its all always up for debate in a dynamic republic.  Maybe we ought to discuss extending that woman's right to her own body beyond that 3 trimester test in Roe!I am pro choice, but that does not mean I think we should shut up about the law or the constitution and just discuss economics or social implications of abortion.
