Theories of SARS-CoV-2 origin It  is improbable t hat  SARS-CoV-2 emerged t hrough laborat ory man ipulat ion  of a relat ed SARS-CoV-like coron avirus.

Alt hough RaTG13, sampled from a Rhin olophus affin is bat 1, is ~96% iden ical overall t o SARS-CoV-2, it s spike diverges in  t he RBD, which suggest s t hat  it  may n ot  bin d efficien ly t o human  ACE27 (Fig. 1a).
