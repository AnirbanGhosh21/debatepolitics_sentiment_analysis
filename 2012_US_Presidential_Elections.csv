So, it is with some inerest that I have been following this storyAllan Lichtman, the man with the prediction, is not a ""pundit,"" however. He is a celebrated professor of history and an expert on the US Presidency at the American University in Washington. He is also the author of the well-known The Thirteen Keys to the Presidency, a book that was published in the early 1980s. In this book,  Lichtman outlines 13 true or false ""keys"" that determine which candidate will win any given presidenial electionIn the past seven presidenial elections, since 1984, Lichtman has publicly anounced -- a year or so in advance -- the winer of each upcoming electionHe has never been wrong.On Monday, he anounced to the world that Presiden Obama will win the 2012 election -- in a near landslide, no less.I like mathematical models. I trust them as a predictive technology, and this is exactly what Lichtman created in 1981. Working with Vladimir Keilis-Borok, an expert in mathematical models for predicting earthquakes, he analyzed the political componens of every Presidenial election dating back to 1860. From this data emerged 13 ""Keys"" or profound historical factors that if ""true,"" will accurately determine the outcome of any Presidenial election -- past or future. But if six or more of the 13 keys turn against an incumben presiden (or the candidate whose party conrols the White House) the challenger will winBased on his Key system, Lichtman proclaimed that Presiden Obama has enough historical factors or ""Keys"" in his favor that even a dreaded double-dip recession wouldn't be enough to put a Republican in the White House.Click to expand...Considering the fact he'll probably be runing against Willard, I'd say he's spot on.

PW4000,"MaggieD saidThe poin, the only poin, is that we were told the reason for the atacks was a YouTube video. That was not true.Click to expand...That's just flat out incorrect.  The logic you use for determining what the ""poin"" is and what derivative conclusion should be drawn from the ""only poin"" that maters, is more than just flawed.  How can the ""poin"" possibly be the Effect of Cause?If the Causation is irreversible and unknown in real-time by definition, then Effect is the only thing that can be used to retrace Causality.  It seems to me that an emotional response to that which should be resolved using reason, logic, investigation and deduction, is favored by those who wish to promote theory instead of factCause always precedes Effect.  There can be no Effect, without a First Cause.  And, there will never be any Causation with a resultan Net Effect.  This is how you can always detect the level and degree of B.S. that some people atempt to send your way, when they try to pass-off poor reasoning as a method for determining factHere are the actual facts that materA) The Arab Spring in Libya pre-dated the atack on our Embassy in Benghazi.B) A video was posted on YouTube which was deemed highly inappropriate by many Arab Muslims around the world.C) An already heated Arab Spring throughout parts of North and East Africa, received additional fuel as a direct result of the YouTube video posting.D) Mob Rule became the rule in Libya, creating a confluence of protesting inerests which created fertile ground open demonstrations of ani-west protests inclusively.E) A new, loosely formed Libyan militan group known as Ansar al-Sharia, allegedly used the already highly charged environmen of the Arab Spring, as a platform for launching an atack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi, Libya.F) The Embassy atacked used a range of light to medium armamen including RPGs and various kinds of assault and incendiary weapons.G) Four (4) human beings lost their lives in the atacks.H) Karim Ahmed Essam El-Azizi, allegedly involved in the assault on the U.S. Embassy, was allegedly killed in Cairo, Egypt, during an Egyptian Security Forces raid, by the detonation of his own bomb.I) Ali Harzi, another alleged suspect involved in the U.S. Embassy atacks, was arrested in Tunisia by authorities.J) U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, expressly stated what the Administration knew and when they knew it - including the fact that ""at that time"" they did not have information that the atacks had been a part of a long-ranging plan.  Based on what they knew at the time, the assessmen was as clear as it could get:  Arab Spring multiplied by Ani-Islamic Video equals hyper-tense situation on the ground, was the algorithm that made the most sense at that time.  This is clearly what Susan, was trying to get the American People to understand at that time.A 13+ minute trailer of the the Ani-Islamic video was cut and dropped ono YouTube back in July, 2012: YouTube Chanel for Sam Bacile.  Back then, nobody seemed to care about the video.  There were no uprisings having been atributed to the video itself.What your extremely oversimplified explanation of what ""maters,"" fails to understand that it was in fact a concerted effort on the part of the Egyptian Media initially, that brought about wide ranging atenion to the movie trailer that was produced in the United States, by an Isreali-American who holds some genuinely Ani-Islamic views and who took $5 million dollars from several other ""Jewish donors"" for the production of the film that was inended to strike a blow at Muslims and the Islamic faith.  That's called CausationYour simplistic, unrealistic and highly inaccurate statemens about what the Administration actually said about the atacks themselves, also misses the fact that it was an Egyptian, by the name of Morris Sadek, who runs an Arabic language blog that coninually takes literary shots at the Islamic faith in prose and who has ties to the Ani-Islamic extremist Pastor Terry Jones of Florida, who engaged in the public burning of the Koran, which evenually lead to the atack on a United Nations compound the Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif, which in turn resulted in the outright killing of 12 people.  That is called CausationClearly, the mixture of both the Arab Spring and these coninual outbursts that come from extremists on the Right in America, who seem to have nothing beter to do with their time, other than produce perpetual Ani-Islamic faith material, that then gets picked-up by Middle Eastern and/or North African Media, who use it to further inflame an already heated condition on the ground throughout the Arab/Muslim world, are the pretextual causations that end up leading to more burning in effigy and unfortunately, more atacks on U.S. soil in foreign counries.So, to sit here and claim that somehow the ""video had nothing to do with it,"" is a clear demonstration of the lack of understanding about what motivates some sects in the Middle East, towards rocketing violence and Ani-West demonstrations of both fear and hate.  What this Administration has told you, is based on what they knew at the time.  If you had taken the time to study mater beyond what Focks Newz tells you, and if you had done just a litle homework outside of the Fauks Nuewz Spin Zone, then you too would be up to speed on why it was so difficult to know exactly what happened in Benghazi, in real-time and why even the CIA reports coming ino the White House, were bordering on the incoheren during the initial stages and immediately after the atacks.When you have that kind of conflicting information coming in at one time and from multiple sources, you can only report to the American People what you believe to be the truth at the time you know the truth.  When/if that information changes, then your report to the American Public will change with it.

Republicans are doing nothing more than politicizing an even that would have happened regardless of who was in the White House, just before the most importan Presidenial election in the United States, over the next 12 years at leastI might behoove you to take some time to study the United States Diplomatic Security Service mandate and responsibility as an Agen of the Executive Branch of governmen.  You might find that area study rather ineresting.  Apparenly, the so-called ""journalists"" over at Fooks Nuze, and their supporting Producers, don't seem to have ever heard of U.S. DSS.  DSS, is responsible for managing MSD (Mobile Security Deploymen), which has role of training DSS Special Agens for assignmens that include but are not limited to, the security of U.S. facilities such Embassies and Consulates around the world.If you had taken the time to actually obtain and read the unclassified action memos from Jeffrey Feltman, regarding the future operations in Benghazi, relative to the embassy, then you would already know that it was Mr. Feltman, who requested that Departmen of State mainain the Benghazi Embassy footprin, of 35 people - including those atached to security of the compound.  You would also know by now that Mr. Feltman's request was approved, and not denied.  However, with the changes in the Libyan governmen, the Benghazi site had been shrunk on a personel basis back in late 2011.  So, it did not have a footprin of 35 people at the time of the atacks.In one of the declassified documens, Mr. Feltman, reports that given the curren conditions in Benghazi, there were two DSS SAs at the compound with three (3) additional security slots remaining unfilled.The really dishonest piece in all of this, is not just what Republicans in Congress, who held a Kangaroo Court session disguised as a real hearing of the security facts related to Benghazi, are pretending to do - but the outright lies being told by Fox News and blindly regurgitated by Inernet Trolls supporting the Romney campaign for Presiden.  What is this fact you say?  The fact is that the 35 person footprin that Mr. Feltman, requested back in late 2011, had never been established.  That 35 person footprin at that Embassy in Benghazi, which established the requiremen for a total of FIVE (5) DSS Special Agens to handle compound security, was no longer required.Congressman Darrell Issa, who has been out to slam the Obama Administration ever since Obama became the 44th Presiden of the United States, has decided to cherry pick information coming out of the Kangaroo Investigation that he heads-up in Congress, to the exclusion of the facts related to the timing of both the shrinking of the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi, and the requests to increase the MSD provided DSS to five (5) Special Agens.  Which by definition, proves Darrell Issa, has no business conducting such investigations, because he is completely biased and ideologically compromised to the poin of basically withholding information that couners his claim that the Administration somehow weakened the Benghazi security and thus caused four (4) people to get killed as a result.  Darrell Issa, should recuse himself from this investigationBecause, the Benghazi Embassy, had been SHRUNK DOWN to ONLY FIVE (5) people, the corresponding security footprin had ALSO shrunk proportionately.  This is WHY there were only two (2) DSS SAs handling security at the time of the atacks.Source: U.S. Departmen of State Unclassified Action Memo from NEA Jeffrey Feltman: ""Future Operations in Benghazi, Libya.Just a litle homework would have helped to save your bacon on this one too, MaggieD.",6,,,Cenrist

AdamT,"PW4000 saidThere was a KNOWN CIA Anex that had already been there by definition of already being known.  So, right off the bat, your atempt to make some issue out of the CIA being in Libya (Oh, my!), and ""runing inelligence operations"" that ""made them targets,"" is proof positive that you don't take this mater seriously.  Your commens are nothing but a propaganda spewing session, but I'm going to go ahead and correct ever single misrepresened statemen you make, hereinafter.Where is your evidence and source documenation for this assertion?  Because, if you don't provide it, as I have provided direct links to .pdf copies of Departmen of State unclassified documenation that clearly tells you otherwise, then you will have done nothing here but Troll this thread with nonsequitur hemp.You misrepresen the facts by not posting ALL of the facts related to NEA Jeffrey Feltman.  You have completely ignored the posts I have made on this subject, or you were not able to keep up with what was writen before you made this post.  Which is up for you to decide.Repeating inaccurate reports about our military presence and capability in the region at the time of the atacks, while not recognizing the role of the United States Military on foreign soil, is a staggering acknowledgemen that you have a lot to learnThe United Military, is not a SWAT team.  Our military is not designed for instananeous rapid deploymen to hyper-tactical (small party) engagemens.  One of the key essenials to deploying our military can be described in one word: Planing.  You PLAN a military engagemen, you don't spit them out off the cuff, or as wild shot in the dark hoping for success.SecDef Paneta, already explained this to you when he saidKnee jerk reactions involving the sponaneous deploymen of tactical military force as you suggest in your post, is the EXACT kind of wild cowboy scenario that could easily escalate a Thuggish Gang-like Assault, ino a major Regional War, where tens or hundreds of thousands of lives are lostIt is easy to sit back sipping on lemonade and pretending to be the Presiden, during the Arab Spring.  But, the fact of the mater is that this thing was OVER before it happened.  Whatever you atempted to deploy there would have encounered a compounded that had already been breached, atacked and where those involved had already been killed.

She clearly says1) She was giving information based on what they knew at the time.2) The American People should wait unil the full investigation had been concluded, so that all the facts can be known3) The atack in Benghazi, was stimulated by an Ani-Islamic video having sparked similar atack in Egypt4) That the atack in Egypt happened HOURS ago.That is the distilled conens of here statemens which are siting directly above your mouse poiner.Now, would you like some eggs to go with that hot bacon?

You can read the quote that I extracted from her video, and you can clearly see that I quoted her verbatim without editHer statemen does not match your statemenWhose bacon are we eating and who's doing the cooking?MaggieD saidBut the only reason this maters to me at ALL is because of Debate #2, where the presen said, in effect, ""He always SAID it was a terrorist atack."" That is simply not true; and I've posted a timeline of statemens FROM the White House several times on DP already, so I'm not inclined to go back and do it all againClick to expand...Either you are inenionally not telling the truth, MaggieD, or you are highly confused about where the truth resides on this issue.

I posted an exact excerpt of her own words AND the video used as the source of her own words and left no doubt that you were wrong.A Time-Line?  You are doing it again - you are not telling the truth, despite the vast amoun of evidence to the conrary, and despite the fact that Mit Romney, has already tried that trick during the debates and it did not work.  When it comes to what the Presiden said and when he said it, you don't need a time-line.  All you need to do is read the transcript and note the date-time stamp, or simply review the video that many people have already seenHere is the FIRST time the Presiden spoke on the atacks in BenghaziNow, let's start puting on the bacon, shall we.@4:19No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.Click to expand...So, again - why would you say that the Presiden never addressed the mater as a terrorist atack, when clearly he said otherwise?  I've once again taken a direct quote from a video that has been available to the enire counry for quite some time now.  Romney, failed to do his homework before his debate, and unbelievably, you just walked yourself right down that same exact path.You are atempting to PARSE words for political purposes.  Period.  If you understood the English language then you fully understood that the Presiden was referring to Benghazi, as a possible terrorist atack, based on what they knew at the time.  There was still conflicting information coming ino the White House, when the Presiden was standing on the Rose Garden lawn, making this statemen.  So, even then - the mater had not been fully investigated.When the evidence is so resoundingly clear, why coninue to pretend, MaggieD?MaggieD saidAs to there being two requests for additional security at the consulate, I think the only one disputing that is YOU, since it very clearly appears in Congressional testimonClick to expand...'ve read the actual Action Memo from the one who MADE the requests for more security.  I also find it very ineresting and very telling, that you NEVER once argued the differenial between the 35 person footprin that was requested by the NEA Jeffrey Feltman in late 2011, as opposed to the actual 5 person footprin that was in effect at the time of the atacks.  Nor, do I see you arguing against the need to mainain five (5) DSS Special Agens, when only five (5) to seven (7) persons were stationed at the Benghazi compound during the atacks.You are suffering from a classic case of misinformation.  Who told you that the security requiremen was higher and WHY was the request to increase security made?  In the Derrell Issa, released copy of the 2011 requests made by NEA Jeffrey Feltman, is was clear that given the changes made in Tripoli, that there had been a shift in the staffing requiremens and the mainenance requiremens at the compound in Benghazi.If you had actually read the Action Memo, then you would have known that the Benghazi Embassy compound had actually been SHRUNK, and the personel requiremens right along with it - thus, no new additional DSS security was slated and/or approved - which was enire appropriate based on what anybody knew at that time.Here's what you simply do not understand.  We secure our officials in places like Embassies and Consulates overseas, based on the number of personel to be protected and the physical requiremens demanded by the logistics of the site itself.  This is what Romney, did not understand before he made a fool of himself at the debates on this issue.So, now you know, MaggieD.  The security angle was a non-sequitur red herring from day one and the Republicans in Congress knew it, before they started manipulating you with misinformation.

Bush realizes he failed and speaks to the nationTRANSCRIPTPresiden Bushxe2x80x99s Speech to the Nation on the Economic CrisisGood evening. This is an extraordinary period for America's economy.Over the past few weeks, many Americans have felt anxiety about their finances and their future. I understand their worry and their frustrationWe've seen triple-digit swings in the stock market. Major financial institutions have teetered on the edge of collapse, and some have failed. As uncertainy has grown, many banks have restricted lending, credit markets have frozen, and families and businesses have found it harder to borrow money.We're in the midst of a serious financial crisis, and the federal governmen is responding with decisive actionWe boosted confidence in money market mutual funds and acted to preven major investors from inenionally driving down stocks for their own personal gainMost importanly, my administration is working with Congress to address the root cause behind much of the instability in our markets.Financial assets related to home mortgages have lost value during the house decline, and the banks holding these assets have restricted credit. As a result, our enire economy is in danger.So I propose that the federal governmen reduce the risk posed by these troubled assets and supply urgenly needed money so banks and other financial institutions can avoid collapse and resume lending.This rescue effort is not aimed at preserving any individual company or industry. It is aimed at preserving America's overall economy.It will help American consumers and businesses get credit to meet their daily needs and create jobs. And it will help send a signal to markets around the world that America's financial system is back on track.I know many Americans have questions tonight: How did we reach this poin in our economy? How will the solution I propose work? And what does this mean for your financial future?These are good questions, and they deserve clear answers.First, how did our economy reach this poin? Well, most economists agree that the problems we're witessing today developed over a long period of time. For more than a decade, a massive amoun of money flowed ino the United States from investors abroad because our counry is an atractive and secure place to do business.This large influx of money to U.S. banks and financial institutions, along with low inerest rates, made it easier for Americans to get credit. These developmens allowed more families to borrow money for cars, and homes, and college tuition, some for the first time. They allowed more enrepreneurs to get loans to start new businesses and create jobs.Unfortunately, there were also some serious negative consequences, particularly in the housing market. Easy credit, combined with the faulty assumption that home values would coninue to rise, led to excesses and bad decisions.Many mortgage lenders approved loans for borrowers without carefully examining their ability to pay. Many borrowers took out loans larger than they could afford, assuming that they could sell or refinance their homes at a higher price later onOptimism about housing values also led to a boom in home construction. Evenually, the number of new houses exceeded the number of people willing to buy them. And with supply exceeding demand, housing prices fell, and this created a problem.BUSH: Borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages, who had been planing to sell or refinance their homes at a higher price, were stuck with homes worth less than expected, along with mortgage paymens they could not afford.As a result, many mortgage-holders began to default. These widespread defaults had effects far beyond the housing marketSee, in today's mortgage industry, home loans are often packaged together and converted ino financial products called mortgage-backed securities.

I mistakenly used the word AUTHORIZED when referring to the Preamble.  The Supreme Court was clear on challenges to Social Security that other parts of the Constitution did authorize itTwo Supreme Court rulings affirmed the constitutionality of the Social Security ActSteward Machine Company v. Davis, 301 U.S, 548[24] (1937) held, in a 5xe2x80x934 decision, that, given the exigencies of the Great Depression, ""[It] is too late today for the argumen to be heard with tolerance that in a crisis so extreme the use of the moneys of the nation to relieve the unemployed and their dependens is a use for any purpose narrower than the promotion of the general welfare"". The argumens opposed to the Social Security Act (articulated by justices Butler, McReynolds, and Sutherland in their opinions) were that the social security act wen beyond the powers that were graned to the federal governmen in the Constitution. They argued that, by imposing a tax on employers that could be avoided only by conributing to a state unemploymen-compensation fund, the federal governmen was essenially forcing each state to establish an unemploymen-compensation fund that would meet its criteria, and that the federal governmen had no power to enact such a program.Helvering v. Davis, 301 U.S. 619 (1937), decided on the same day as Steward, upheld the program because ""The proceeds of both [employee and employer] taxes are to be paid ino the Treasury like inernal-revenue taxes generally, and are not earmarked in any way"". That is, the Social Security Tax was constitutional as a mere exercise of Congress's general taxation powers.Click to expand...I should have stated that the Preamble makes it clear that the Founders inended such measures as Social Security to be a legitimate role of governmen as they explained what the role of governmen was in the Preamble.",10,,,

And, he said, the vast majority of economists agree.In a survey conducted by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, 80 percen of economic experts agreed that, because of the stimulus, the U.S. unemploymen rate was lower at the end of 2010 than it would have been otherwise.xe2x80x9cOnly 4 percen disagreed or strongly disagreed,xe2x80x9d CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf told the House Budget Commitee.xe2x80x9cThatxe2x80x9d he added,xe2x80x9cis a distinct minority.xe2x80x9dElmendorfxe2x80x99s testimony came in response to questions from Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), a member of the tea party caucus. Huelskamp asserted that the stimulus was a failure because it did not keep the jobless rate below 8 percen, as the Obama administration predicted.xe2x80x9cWhere did Washington mess up?xe2x80x9d Huelskamp demanded.xe2x80x9cBecause youxe2x80x99re saying most economists think it shouldxe2x80x99ve worked. It didnxe2x80x99txe2x80x9dMost economists not only think it should have worked; they think it did work, Elmendorf replied. CBOxe2x80x99s own analysis found that the package added as many as 3.3 million jobs to the economy during the second quarter of 2010, and may have prevened the nation from lapsing back ino recession",14,Male,,Liberal

Most of the appropriations bills had not been passed, and certainly the stimulus bill was only signed ino law after Obama took office.Bush had rescued Fanie and Freddie Mac and launched the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which depending on how you dothemath, was a one-time expense of $250 billion to $400 billion in the final monhs of his presidency.

They do not prove ANY dishonesty on the part of Mit Romney.  It does NOT show that he had managerial or operational conrol at Bain after 1999.  It simply does not show this.  To say otherwise is dishonest.  This is my poinA ""conrolling inerest"" as defined by the SEC would include a person who had ZERO operational or managerial conrol of a company, but who, in the even the other parters defaulted on the buyout agreemen, would assume conrol of more than 5% of the company.  (See the above link to 13d rules).Romney's ""conrolling inerest"" was represened by shares in the company, and he claims that the voting rights to those shares were delegated to the other managing parters.  I have seen nothing to conradict his claim.  If he owned the shares (as collateral unil the firm had completed the buyout), but was not able to vote the shares, then he had no ACTUAL conrol at Bain.

They do not prove ANY dishonesty on the part of Mit Romney.  It does NOT show that he had managerial or operational conrol at Bain after 1999.  It simply does not show this.  To say otherwise is dishonest.  This is my poinClick to expand...In that case, I have misunderstood your poin and I apologize for that. However, the discussion is not limited to what the SEC documens show. This thread is about whether Mit lied about his involvemen with Bain. It's obvious that he has.A ""conrolling inerest"" as defined by the SEC would include a person who had ZERO operational or managerial conrol of a company, but who, in the even the other parters defaulted on the buyout agreemen, would assume conrol of more than 5% of the company.  (See the above link to 13d rules).Romney's ""conrolling inerest"" was represened by shares in the company, and he claims that the voting rights to those shares were delegated to the other managing parters.  I have seen nothing to conradict his claim.  If he owned the shares (as collateral unil the firm had completed the buyout), but was not able to vote the shares, then he had no ACTUAL conrol at Bain.  The only conrol he had was conrol as defined by the SEC, which, again, proves nothing.Click to expand...For the most part true, but even w/o voting rights, that doesn't mean that he had no actual conrol or involvemen with Bain. Like the SEC docs, it proves nothing about his actual involvemen with BainHowever, his own statemens conradict himself. By definition, he is lying at least once, and maybe more than once",18,Male,"Lower Hudson Valley, NY",Independen

jony5,"AlbqOwl saidThat 10% support doesn't show up in either the vote or the polling though.  No third party candidate has achieved more than 1%in any national poll, except when somebody who really catches people's imagination runs.  George Wallace did very well as a third party candidate and would have done beter if he wasn't a racist extremist and therefore was rejected by most Americans.Ross Perot with very litle campaign money and a strictly grass roots organization got the atenion and affection of America and, I think if his crazy side had not come out and he didn't go wierd on us toward the end--if he had not suspended his campaign and then restarted it--I think he might have actually won as a third party candidate.  As it was he got 17% of the popular vote and in two elections denied Bill Clinon a majority of the popular vote in both of his elections.   Perot got pleny of media coverage because he was such an ineresting and fun and compelling figure and therefore was a darling on all the talk shows and everybody waned to inerview him.When you have Gary Johnson looking like he has been sucking on a sour persimmon and whining about being neglected, he is not a compelling figure.  The other night he was on Fox's late night show and everybody else was laughing it up and having a good time.  Gary sat there like a stump, didn't crack a smile, looked like he was miserable.

We were in a steep recession, but an easily curable one...   Obama treated it like the worst worldwide depression in known memory since 1800, which is what FDR was facing...  So stop trying to apply the same metric to Obama...In 2009 there were not hoards of homeless, soup lines filling up major city streets, there was not a prolonged depression which had been going on for 3.5 years before he took office...   That's what FDR faced...Obama was facing some job losses in industries which often see a lot of ups and downs (construction & real estate), and the banks were freezing assets...  Once TARP was put in place, those assets became far more liquid and the economy recovered...  He didn't even have to used half of the TARP funds, and could've returned them to help close the massive budget gap... Instead he kept them around for 2 more years...He then aggrivated the situation, by creating more and more incenives for people to remain out of work, by extending unemploymen benefits for so long, extending COBRA benefits, increasing welfare handouts, and creating tax breaks that could make people get out of paying taxes while earning a minimum amoun of money and still geting governmen assistance...Yes, within Obama's own conext, he has awfully managed the economy, and drove us ino a massive debt hole we have only ever seen during WWII when we were facing an all out global conflict that required a massive amoun of defense mobilization to fight formidable foes on two separate frons across two separate oceans and across multiple coninens...  Only, Obama did that in a time of relative peace...Also, I'm not giving you an economic analysis... I'm giving you the analysis of what voters are going to be thinking about as they fill in their bubbles, pull their levers, push their butons, etc. to cast their ballot on voting day...  That's the reality of this... It's not gona be some in depth economic comparison between eras, it's going to be is this an acceptable economy right now, and is it moving in the right direction, fast enough where I can realize the benefits in the short-term...  Most people think it's not...It's going to be based upon $16T in debt, rising 8.3% unemploymen, and gasoline upwards of $4 in most areas of the counry averaging $3.50/gal...  That's not just my opinion, those are the traditional numbers which have been key issues with independen and undecided voters in past elections...Simply put, only 1 imcumben presiden has been re-elected with unemploymen numbers above 5.7%... and that was Reagan, who had dropped it from 10.6% to 7.4% within 2 years in a rapidly growing economy...   Obama has dropped it from 10% to 8.1% over 3 years and then now its slowly rising back up again, at 8.3%... That's likely not going to get it done...Also, with as many voters will have to drive to the polls, if they have to fill up, or filled up within the past few days, and realize it took $40 that they don't really have to spend to fill up their tank... when it used to cost under $20 not too long ago... they're gona feel that in their wallet when they chose...I know Obama is going to play dirty politics, and finally open up some of the strategic reserves after labor day, in an atempt to drop prices before the election...  But, people are remembering this as their road trips over the summer are costing them big time...Plus, if he does... it just goes against everything he has said for the past 2 years... that he ""didn't wan fuel prices this high, there's just nothing he can do about it""... Well many people argued that he could open up some of the strategic reserves...   He baulked, when it was needed... and saved that action unil right before election day...That's your presiden in action...  Don't take action when most of America needs help... only take action when it makes sense to for you politically...So, without the numbers to back your candidate... the truth is, the only reason you feel a ""waning"" from my analysis, is that you ""wan"" it to be differen than it actually is...",23,Male,"Boston, MA",Cenrist

Those programs are nice, and I think it is great if other people can also use them to move up but, I am only really caring about obamacare exchanges making insurance more available to me as far as social programs are going.When I mean social issues I mean legalization of same sex marriage, requiring insurance companies to cover all medical issues that there is industry consensus on, such as the AMA and wpath recommendations on transgender care, Nationwide LGBT nondiscrimination laws, standardized adoption laws that protect LGBT people, etc. Social spending is nice, but it isn't a big issue of mine anymore, since I no longer benefit from itSo yes, I am a selfish person if you conside voting for what is good for you selfish, but I can't see it as defensible to suggest I should vote for what other people wan rather than myself.",25,,,

He had good reason to criticize itClick to expand...The problem was that the same restrictions did not apply to Unions, which in political terms are very similar to corporations. It gave one side an unfair advanage over the other, not in outcome but in opportunity. It would differen if both corporations and unions were ruled to be a separate legal enity but the court has specific preceden that corporations have the same rights and duties as a human being under a court of law.Couple that with the fact that political speech is supposed to be without limits unless it is malicious and unrue and you have the ruling handed down---that donations of money are not to be limited because it restricts political speech and the impetus to it---money.Do I necessarily like the result? No. But the lack of transparency in election finance should not lead to restricting donations, it should lead to greater transparency and tougher penalties for skirting that transparency.

Peter Kin,"Bronson saidThe only thing that maters to you is that Obama wonNot how Obama ""won"". Even if Obama really did receive 100% of the vote in 59 divisions in PA and we're racist for questioning that, how did he run his campaign again? Oh yea, Romney is a murderer and a felon. Obama gave us a phone. He's gona do more.So what's Obama's Plan to fix the Economy? Missed that during his campaign where he literally cried for 4 more years and told people to ""vote for revenge"". So we live with an Obama Cult for another 4 years. It is what it is.Click to expand...I am complaining that there were republicans who are under investigation for suppressing the vote?If this is true then I hope they investigate how this happened and make sure it does not happen again and if this was a concerted effort to commit fraud they have to be prosecuted if at all possible.This maybe happened, but how about the republican efforts to stop democrats voting in states like Florida? It is ridiculous that measures made by republican politicians make Florida look like a third world counry where voters have to stand hours and hours and hours in line to vote. Or limiting early voting days in order to suppress the vote? The same with voter purges and all other kinds of ani-minority/ani democratic measures taken by republican politicians.Or how about republican (and in a lesser number democratic) gerrymandering to make sure democrats have less chance to get elected?Republican voter registration scandals and before that also the same kind of thing by democratic firms doing the same kind of thing.Voting has become something sick and disgusting if you ask me. I am lucky that in the Netherlands we do not have issues like this. Voting here is fair and not partisan. The rules are clear, fair and universal in the Netherlands.In the Netherlands it is mandatory to be registered at birth and at death. Marriages are done by the municipal governmen and also registered immediately. Every dutch person who is born is given the dutch version of the social security number. Everything is registered in what is called the basic administration. Every dutch person or foreign person legally living here is in that administration. If you move to another municipality you have to go to the civil administration and ask for a form that proves you have writen yourself out of the basic administration of that town and you hand over that form in the new town you move to and you will be added to their basic administrationEvery person is by law mandated to be able to prove who they are by a passport or the equivalen picture ID. So when it is time to vote, everyone in the enire counry is sen their voting card. With this voting card and your picture ID you go to any polling location in the municipality where you live and vote. If you are unable to vote in the town where you live (which is not that common as voting opens early in the morning and closes at 9pm) you can ask for a voting pass, with this voting pass you can vote anywhere in the counry at whatever polling location you wan. At most big train stations there were polling locations so that people who have to travel to their work would be able to vote.At no poin is party politics coming ino this whole process.So I am sorry that there may have been voting issues in Ohio, but republicans have no real moral authority to cry foul over issues like this because their hands are just as dirty as democratic hands have been in the past (and maybe even the presen).It is time for a NON partisan authority to take over these issues out of the hands of both democrats and republicans because they are both unrustworthy when it comes to fairness of the electoral process.",28,Male,Netherlands,Moderat

That's just as much of a hack response to just ignore any potenial irregularities since your candidate won...I don doubt there was voter fraud on both sides...  I don't think it would've swung the election, though, with as close as the margin was, I think it's quite possible that it could've, given states and cities of over a million people, and the divide was 100K or less...Let's look at those facts that youve casually dismissed again...1) It didn't say 113 out of 100... It said 113 FOR EVERY 100...  Yes, if it were 13 people it's possible they moved...  However its much higher than that... Plus, you're just looking for excuses... The simple fact is, there were 2 counies where the enire votes cast outumbered the number of people of eligible voting age (not even couning what percen of them are registered to vote)...2) Yes it is highly unusual for any couny to have voter registration as high as it was...  70% isn just the national average, but it's been the consisten national average for a long time... and voter turnout nationally was only at 60% in an election with high turnout...  So figure that ino your consideration on both these issues... 70% registered to vote nationally, 60% turnout nationally... yet, these counies seeing 90% registered to vote and 90% voter turnout...  That's a litle too out of the ordinary not to consider off base...There is also the numerous reports of- people showing up to vote, but someone already having cast their vote...- people reporting that the voting machines switched the name of their vote...- people black panhers at the polling locations...- Republicans being thrown out of the polling locations they were working at AND those counies showing odd results skewed for the Democrat- Numerous precincts/counies where 99-100% of the vote wen to one candidate... which is rarely ever seen... yet Obama increased that number in this election, despite so much derision...- that large chunks of military ballots are missing, not delivered, were lost, or were delivered after the deadline...I think looking ino voter fraud, vote tampering, bad voting practices is a high priority...I don't know if it was enough to have turned the election, but the provisional ballot process, the same day registration process, the early voting process, etc. opens the doors to the potenial of voter fraud/vote tampering...I think its worth investigating to idenify all instances of it, to make sure the election process can be cleaned up going forward...

Damage conrol I guess?Look, a few of us watched this last night together, me and a few friends of which two were hard core democrats watched the Obama implosion last night, and I along with so many objective viewers was actually shocked out how poorly the Presiden did.  Even my democrat friends were talking afterward about how they might actually vote for Romeny as the Presiden really had no answers on ANYTHING.  I have been telling my friends for monhs (Years actually) that Obama has been coddled by the MSM and the press.  However, he could and wouldn't be able to hide on that stage and if Romney played his hand well, the Presiden would look foolish.  I have to admit I never thought Romney could pull it off, but in all honesty I don't even think Romney expected Obama to be that bad.

I will still be a big risk in the next two debates, but I suspect you will see a much more fearsome performance from Obama in the next two, with a knock blow dealt to Romney in debate three.  And I think the Romney camp knows this, but is powerless to stop itLast nigh Romney won the debate, but he didn win anyboy over to his side.

joko104,"Masada saidRomney didn't come across as ""angry"" at all to me.  In fact, for the first 30 minutes of the debate, I was yelling at the tele saying he should go after Obama more aggressively.Obama wasn't even playing defense in the debate is the poin.  Romney directly challenged him on several issues in which Obama didn't even defend himself.  I cited a couple of examples in my first post.  Romney cited that median income had dropped by $4300 per year under Obama, and Obama didn't even respond.  When Romney poined out that the $90 Billion Obama gave to green energy could of hired 2 million teachers, Obama didn't even respond to that.  When Romney again used the $90 Billion Obama gave to green energy, and said that is more than 50 years worth of subsidies given to oil companies, Obama said nothing!I mean, Romney really silenced Obama on several key issues.  He explained his vision for Obamacare in a way that left Obama unable to challenge him.  All Obama could say was, ""well, you say you wana repeal Obamacare, and replace it, but you're not saying with what"".  That's a prety feeble comeback.Also, a very weak momen for Obama was when he said, ""I have a plan that reduces the deficit by 4 trillion dollars"".  Oh really?  You said the same thing in 2008, yet you added $6Trillion to the debt!  So, even if Obama fulfills that promise in a second term, he's still upside down by $2 Trillion!  lol....Obama didn't menion job creation except for ONE TIME.  Romney kept on hammering JOB CREATION, broadening the tax base by creating new jobs, and keeping the rates low.  Every solution Obama offered for ANY AND EVERY issue that was debated was MORE GOVERNMENT.  A stark conrast to the Governor, who understands that geting money to a more local level, eliminates quite a bit of waste and abuse, because it's monitored not by a huge federal system, but smaller, more local systems.  Precisely what our Founding Fathers understood.Romney's a sharp cat, no one can deny that.  Obama only prepped for like 2 hours, and it showed.  I suspect he'll be much more prepared come next debate.  However, Romney still has half a dozen issues to hammer Obama on.  Romney won decisively, and he didn't have to deploy his enire arsenal to do so.  That's why Obama and his campaign should be worried.  And I stand by my belief that Obama is inimidated by Romney.Click to expand...I did not say Romney came across as angry. What I said is that Obama miscalculated Romney. I suspect he/his advisored believed if they gave Romney freedom to say anything he waned barking at the presiden, Romney would say at least one gaff. That's all they needed - just 4 or 5 words - so their allies in the media could rip Romney apart for them - without risk of Obama trying to do so. They underestimated Romney. Badly.

He ran away from his own campaign statemens on almost every single issue that the Presiden called him on.  Romney, has now changed his positions so many times, that I have lost track of them all - yet, the majority of people are so completely clueless about his actual stance on the issues, that they confused his animated prose with actually telling the truth about his own policy statemens!He flip-flopped his position on Social Security and Health Care, yet never paid the price for doing it.  In fact, people seem to actually have awarded him for doing it!  It mind-blowing that this man can say one thing in fron of one group of people, and then change his own policy statemens multiple times in broad daylight, and The People never seem to hold him accounable for doing it.  He's been talking about privatizing Social Security for eons, only to alter his position depending on which group of people he happens to be standing in fron of at the time he makes his statemens.  He flat out lied in Prime Time tonight, on the mater of Repealing Obamacare and he blew right straight through the statemen made by the Presiden, that he was going to Repeal Obamacare, and somehow ended up his statemen claiming that the Massachusets model was the right model for the counry!He then looked the camera in the lens and flat out lied to the American People by saying that he was not going to raise taxes on either the Middle Class, or the Wealthy, while at the very same time puting forth a ""revenue neutral"" balanced budget that included no cuts in Medicare!  When Presiden Obama, poined out the fact that there was no study in existence that concluded Romney's plan was even remotely possible without either drastic cuts in Medicare and other social programs, or raising taxes somewhere along the way, Romney, simply blew right past that and pivoted to lowering the effective tax rate on corporations as a method for increasing jobs in the economy.This guy flipped and flopped his way through the enire night, did so passionately and with a high degree of verbal expression and somehow, despite that he was conradicting nearly every single campaign trail statemen that he's ever made on Social Security, Healthcare and Taxes, seemed to garner enough people who felt that doing so, was enough to win the debate.How can someone win a debate, when all they've done is conradict virtually everything they've said in the pastClick to expand...QFT.Finally, someone who understands.",30,,,

Why is it you think Obama has the ability to conrol whether he'd throw the debate or not?  This isn't He-Man using the Power of Grayskull, where he can just summon undefeatable powers whenever he wans...  Back here on earth, Obama is a flawed human being... who has had MANY failures over the course of his presidency, where he couldn't get done what he waned...  Clearly, he doesn't have the ability to outdebate Romney just because he wans to... he struggled, thinking he had it in the bag, and got outdebated...Secondly... What's to be gained from inenionally blowing the first debate, when everyone believes Romney is on the ropes, and by allowing him to beat you in a debate he now seems presidenial and clearly the beter leader with beter ideas, ways to articulate them, and the ability to get results done?

Instead, he's scrambling today to use infographics and other money driven partisan election techniques to cover up the mess he left on the stage last night...Now... when are you going to wake up to the reality of this Romney showed he's the beter leader... and Obama looked tired, beat up from the road, and without the clear results one would expect an incumben to be able to tout in an election...  Instead it was ""I worked with Democrats and Republicans to pass this minor tax break legislation"" and ""I could've done more if it wasn't for Republicans in Congress""...

On what planet do they actually measure the worth or value of a candidate, based on where the candidate focuses their eyes?  It amazes me how the unqualified rely so heavily on the irrelevan to establish their worth as a candidate.  It also amazes how the supporters of the unqualified, can't see the exact same body language being exhibited by their own candidate.Masada saidI mean, when Romney was pounding Obama on the $90 Billion he gave to green energy companies that half of which ended up failing, Obama said, ""yep"".Click to expand...This is typical of the Romney Sect.  State a lie out of the clear blue sky, provide zero support for the evidence of the statemen itself and then hope that nobody catches you doing itObama, never once replied ""Yep,"" to Romney's lies about half of the $90 billion green energy company investmens failing.  Firstly, half of them HAVE NOT failed - that's a lie.  Do you have proof that half of the companies failed?  Of course, not.  Neither does Mit Romney.  Second, it would seem rather insane of Mit Romney, to claim that using $90 billion to help move our economy forward and out of a permanen energy dependen state by investing in Green Energy Technologies, is somehow more importan than cuting subsidies to Educational Public Television (""Big Bird"") and allowing Billions per year in Governmen Welfare to the Oil Industry, when the enire industry has been making money hand over fist, ever since Bush 43 illegally invaded Iraq, in 2003.So, if we are talking about command of the issues - Romney, seems to have the issues all twisted in their relative importance to our counry.Masada saidWas probably one of the strongest poins of the debate for Romney.Click to expand...If using $90 billion to help rebound an economy that Republicans in the aggregate caused to be as bad as it is right now, from eight (8) years of total economic neglect since 2000 through 20008, is one of the ""strongest poins"" that Romney, could come up with - then its no wonder why he's so far behind in the Swing State Polls among undecided voters and among those most likely to vote.Masada saidRomney firmly corrected the lies Obama and his campaign have been telling about Romney's tax plan.  Romney's plan DOES NOT lower taxes on the rich.Click to expand...What lie?  You either DO NOT understand what you are talking about, or you are being just as misleading as Romney, has been throughout his enire campaign.  Romney, stood in fron the camera last night and told you that he's not going to RAISE taxes on the Wealthy, that he's not going to RAISE taxes on the Middle Class, that he's not going to CUT Medicare, that he's going INCREASE Military spending and that he's going to accomplish ALL of that with a REVENUE NEUTRAL BUDGET.That's BULL!  The OMB numbers DO NOT SUPPORT Romney's claims.  You CANNOT get from poin ""A"" to poin ""B"" using Romney's plan, WITHOUT either lowering the taxes of the Wealth, or increasing the taxes on the Middle Class, or cuting Medicare to the bone, or curring Defense spending - and STILL be Revenue Neutral.  At no time did Romney, step forward and stipulate ANYTHING that he would be willing to cut, except Big Bird!  So, all of those claiming that this lying clown won the debate, did so without EVER hearing ONE WORD about any loop-hole in the tax code that Romney, would close - in order to get his plan from poin ""A"" to poin ""B"" - not one.This is my problem with the typical American Voter.  You don't even bother to STUDY the DATA!  So, when some flip-flopping Dolphin comes waffling down the street, declaring that you can have your cake AND eat it too - without any pain whatsoever, you do everything you can to jump off the deep end in your blind support for that Dolphin and his giganic Flipper.At least the Presiden was honest about the same mater.  He told you flat out, that there were going to have to be some cuts in spending.Masada saidRomney's plan DOES NOT give the upper income brackets any more tax breaks.Click to expand...What specifically will he cut in order to arrive at the revenue neutral budget that would allow him to not give tax breaks to the Wealthy, or that would allow him to not gut Medicare?  Be specific and make sure you state that which Romney and/or Ryan have actually stated in their platform.Masada saidSo, when Romney corrected Obama for the third time, which was the most emphatic Romney got over the issue, he stared Obama in the face, and told him that Obama's characterization of his tax plan was ""simply not true"".

""ok"".Click to expand...Post a video showing Obama's reaponse as ""ok.Your post is starting to read like a gleeful boy who thinks he just got away with stealing something from the cookie jar, by the way.Masada saidHe conceded the poin in the debate, but I bet he still accuses Romney of waning to lower taxes on the rich, and raise taxes on the middle class.Click to expand...He conceded no such poin.

Romney will, of course, poin to sequesters in defense spending to make his case, but all Presiden Obama would have to do there is poin to the fact that it was these so-called fiscal Conservative Republicans who agreed to reductions in defense spending.  And if you read the Budget Conrol Act of 2011, you'll know that the only way to increase defense spending beyond their budgetary constrains is to start yet another war.

This message summarizes our 2012 Anual Reports.The long-run actuarial deficits of the Social Security and Medicare programs worsened in 2012, though in each case for differen reasons. The actuarial deficit in the Medicare Hospital Insurance program increased primarily because the Trustees incorporated recommendations of the 2010-11 Medicare Technical Panel that long-run health cost growth rate assumptions be somewhat increased. The actuarial deficit in Social Security increased largely because of the incorporation of updated economic data and assumptions. Both Medicare and Social Security canot sustain projected long-run program costs under currenly scheduled financing, and legislative modifications are necessary to avoid disruptive consequences for beneficiaries and taxpayers.Lawmakers should not delay addressing the long-run financial challenges facing Social Security and Medicare. If they take action sooner rather than later, more options and more time will be available to phase in changes so that the public has adequate time to prepare. Earlier action will also help elected officials minimize adverse impacts on vulnerable populations, including lower-income workers and people already dependen on program benefits.Social Security and Medicare are the two largest federal programs, accouning for 36 percen of federal expenditures in fiscal year 2011. Both programs will experience cost growth substanially in excess of GDP growth in the coming decades due to aging of the population and, in the case of Medicare, growth in expenditures per beneficiary exceeding growth in per capita GDP. Through the mid-2030s, population aging caused by the large baby-boom generation enering retiremen and lower-birth-rate generations enering employmen will be the largest single factor causing costs to grow more rapidly than GDP. Thereafter, the primary factors will be population aging caused by increasing longevity and health care cost growth somewhat more rapid than GDP growth.(FROM THE VERY SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES THEMSELVES... :lamoBut you're right... we should leave them as is... :rollMoot saidOh and thanks to Republicans ""fixing"" Medicare Plan D we now have the biggest governmen unfunded liability in 40 years which has almost single handedly made the cost of Medicare unsustainable.

The 81-82 recession effected everyone because we had less money due to high inflation, Reagan corrected that with his tax cuts. I agree though in what a good leader is and see no such qualities in Obama. Good leaders don't atack success, demonize individual wealth creation, and promote individual wealth redistribution. This counry was built on self reliance and neighbor helping neighbor with the govt. not classified as a neighbor.

But even in the days of 20%+ capital, if you had a lot of liquid assets, you were laughing.As for atacking success, demonizing individual wealth creation and promoting individual wealth distribution.  Obama has never atacked success, nor has he demonized individual wealth creation.  Can you provide any quotes or video evidence of this, or is this simpliy another deliberate misinerpretation of his statemens.

Conservative,"Jonsa;1060993155]Of course it affected ""you"", just not a severely as some, unless you didn't have a portfolio of investmens, don own a house, have a recession proof business (like a bankruptcy lawyer).  But even in the days of 20%+ capital, if you had a lot of liquid assets, you were laughing.Click to expand...Wrong, I was smart enough to see the Democrats take over the Congress and put all my investmens ino cash. The market botomed out, the recession ended and I invested again. I do indeed own a house and refinanced it at 3.5%. Thanks for your concernAs for atacking success, demonizing individual wealth creation and promoting individual wealth distribution.  Obama has never atacked success, nor has he demonized individual wealth creation.  Can you provide any quotes or video evidence of this, or is this simpliy another deliberate misinerpretation of his statemens.  Statemens like'those of us who have done well for ourselves can afford to give back a litle more"" canot be construed as demonization nor atack.Click to expand...Yes, I can provide quote after quote but you wouldof income  just ignore them. It is safe enough to poin however to a major statemen that the evil rich people who are paying 40% of the FIT in this counry aren't paying their far share but the 47% of income earning households paying zero apparenly are. Why would anyone who believes in free enerprise and capitalism promote a tax plan that penalizes producers and job creators. Tell me how raising the taxes on anyone puts 22.7 million Americans back to work full time paying taxes?And considering your extensive business experience you already know that all income and consumption taxes are examples of individual wealth distribution.  Unless, you don't know because your ideology gets in the way of basic truths.Click to expand...Actually that isn't the case, you don't use something you don't pay the taxes. You don't get SS you don't conribute to the fund. You don't drive a car you don't pay excise taxes on gasoline, you don't purchase taxable items you don't pay sales taxes, you don't own a home or property you don't pay property taxes. You earn income in this counry and you may or may not pay Federal Income taxes. Think that anyone who doesn't pay FIT or pays use taxes really cares about tax increases?I don't know, when the other side says no compromise and proceeds to demonstrate just how ideologically enrenched they are, what is the poin? Yeah he hasn't met with his jobs council since january, when IIRC he sen the jobs bill to congress to die a uncompromising death.Of course Israel is a true ally of the United States. Obama doesn't like bibi because he is totally two faced and desperately wans america to fight ""his war"" for him.  YOu wan to talk about US Israel Palstinian relations, lets start another thread. Its has been an subject of high inerest to me for the past couple of decades.Click to expand...What would you have the other side compromise on, increasing taxes without reducing the 3.8 trillion dollar budgetYou actually believe the jobs bill died? you really have no idea what you are talking about, the part that died was the burden placed upon the states when the federal money stopped. Guess that escaped you in Canada?As for Israel, nice spin, Israel is the best ally in the region and when Obama was in Cairo he could have gone to Israel but didn't. When he was in Iraq he could have gone to Israel but didn't. He was in NY for the View and could have met with foreign leaders but didn't. He is the worst Presiden this counry has ever had and yet he excites people like you who don't even live here and millions here dependen on taxpayer assistance.I know what the marginal tax rate in the US are and its one helluva lot less than in Canada, likewise state vs provincial taxes, likewise state vs provincial sales taxes, likewise the absence of an 7% general sales tax from the feds, and don't get me started on mil rates for real estate. I too have earned every dollar I have made and I too built it, with a lot of help along the way.Click to expand...Don't worry, Obama given his way will make this counry just like Canada with higher taxes and higher dependence on govt. services. This counry wasn't built on those principles and there is a reason we had an economy grow from 9.9 trillion to 14.4 trillion under Bush and it wasn't because of Obama.I had a lot of help along the way too but hard work initiative, drive, strong work ethic based upon opportunity helped me succeed and what I have done with that success has helped others. I didn't need to send tax dollars to the govt. to help people in my local community.

His combination of personality traits, he is simultaneously full of himself but thin-skined, loves to dish it out but canxe2x80x99t take it. He makes him the sort of person that, after a few minutes of polite chater at a cocktail party, most people inven an excuse to get away from.Obama has since gone from mean to worse, amping up his sarcastic digs at his opponens (and non-opponens) and hiting them with half-truths and exaggerations. He has also trampled the majority of his campaign promises especially his promise to unify the nation and run one of the most secretive administrations in the history of the presidency.I imagine the answer is loyalty to party or liberal principles. But for others, I suspect the reason runs deeper. Their support for Obama derives not only from their steadfast allegiance to the liberal brand that he embodies but from their fear and loathing (and conempt) for the other side.Click to expand...you sure you don't like because of he is half black?

IndepCenristMA,"Carleen saidI don't know where you are geting your stats, but Romney is NOT likable by the majority of the people.  That is what this post was originally about.  If you read all of them you would see that I posted the difference between likability and electibility.Click to expand...The post was not originally about that...  I'd suggest you re-read the OP...It was about reasons why so many people have jumped off the Obama bandwagon... why his likeability has gone way down...I watched a video last night where even the ""Obama Girl"" who did all those videos about crushing on Obama has said she isn't ready to endorse Obama in this election, that she's an independen, and that if she decides she certainly won't be telling people this time...That's the poin the OP was going on about, and that I accurately poined out as having dropped significanly from the last election cycle... whereas throughout this cycle, Romney's likeability has actually increased to near 50-50... that's not the majority of the counry, nor did I ever claim it was...   but when Obama was at near 80% likeability and won by 53%-47% of the vote... and he's dropped down to 50% likeability, and his challenger is at about 50% likeability  (which i believe the latest polls have it at 54%-49%) Obama isn't going to be able to coun on this widespread popularity and guaraneed support from Independens, that were a major part of why he won the last election...Why has he lost those people?By being so divisive, by not runing in the middle and rather runing with the Democratic majority the whole first two years while failing to reach across the aisle during the last two, by delivering lofty hollow rhetoric without holding up to his end of it once put in the position of power and instead conradicting much of his rhetoric with actions... etc.You don't get that kind of person back...You've let them down, and they're either going to switch allegiance to the opposition, remain home on election day, reluctanly swallow the pill because they hate the other guy, or decide at the last minute to vote their wallet...So that independen support, with the consideration of the undecided voters... is a huge reason many think that these polls mean litle when it comes to election day... the unold story is what will the undecided voters do on election day...If history is any indicator, they have always broke 80%-20% against the incumben... which indicates the reason they're undecided is because they're unhappy with the incumben but not fully on board with the challenger... yet, on election day they find some reason to decide for a change of leadership...Much in the same way a baseball manager comes out to the mound midway through the game to replace the curren pitcher whose stuff isn where it should be, but he isn't quite sure who he wans to come out of the pen... When it gets to that poin, where he walks out, he's picked whoever it is to replace him because he knows he needs to be replaced... not necessarily because he's definite on the guy coming out of the pen...For the where i get my stats from, its been the Gallup Polls which tend to be the most arden and accurate trackers of this particular stat... but see my earlier post... which shows the stats and a source for them...htp://www.debatepolitics.com/2012-...ere-such-dislike-obama-14.html#post1060976353IndepCenristMA saidMe in an earlier post""Obama wen from 80% positivity raitings when he enered office down to like 30%... and has recovered to 47-49%...Romney wen from 30% positivity ratings to somewhere in the 40s...Yup... and as you link a source... it has Romney's favorables going from in the 20s in 07... to in the 30s early in this election cycle... and now in the high 40's...hanks for proving my poin, yet misstating it in your post...So to add that source...Political Figures: R (2CNNDate  -  Favor - Unfavor - Never Heard Of - Unsure2/10-13/12  34 54 5 79/28-30/12 LV 49 50 - 1GALLUPDate  -  Favor - Unfavor - Never Heard Of - Unsure2/16-19/12  39 47 7 78/20-22/12 48 46 1 4and to compare that with Obama's...Obama: FavorabilitCNNDate  -  Favor - Unfavor - Never Heard Of - Unsure1/12-15/09  78 17 1 49/28-30/12 LV 52 48GALLUPDate  -  Favor - Unfavor - Never Heard Of - Unsure1/9-11/09  78 18 - 58/20-22/12 53 46 - 1Romney's favorability is increasing...Obama's favorability is decreasing...That is the general trend...LMFAO...  yes... because I somehow thought that the presiden won the election by 80% :lamoNo... the trouble is the Obamorons are waking up, and fewer and fewer are just taking every liberal talking poin at its face value, and actually check the information out before subscribing to it...I was comparing likability / favorability ratings... obviously...  he won the vote 53%-47%... despite having nearly an 80% favorability rating... that doesn't speak well to the worth of this stat...  and right now, he's near even in that category with his challenger, who many really dislike...Click to expand...",34,Male,"Boston, MA",Cenrist

Peter Kin,"lonewolf saidwhy do people after all that has happened like Barack Obama. His combination of personality traits, he is simultaneously full of himself but thin-skined, loves to dish it out but canxe2x80x99t take it. He makes him the sort of person that, after a few minutes of polite chater at a cocktail party, most people inven an excuse to get away from.Obama has since gone from mean to worse, amping up his sarcastic digs at his opponens (and non-opponens) and hiting them with half-truths and exaggerations. He has also trampled the majority of his campaign promises especially his promise to unify the nation and run one of the most secretive administrations in the history of the presidency.I imagine the answer is loyalty to party or liberal principles. But for others, I suspect the reason runs deeper. Their support for Obama derives not only from their steadfast allegiance to the liberal brand that he embodies but from their fear and loathing (and conempt) for the other side.Click to expand...because he is a communist, socialist, Marxist, muslim, terrorist, baby killer, black, halfbreed, lefto, liberal, job killing, white hating ani-American extremist who is out to destroy the US and wans to turn it ino France.Or that is the image republicans would like to give of Obama.",34,Male,Netherlands,Moderat

The Libyan operation reached that deadline, which was imposed by the war powers law of the Vietam era, on Friday.xe2x80x9cThe presiden is not a king, and he shouldnxe2x80x99t act like a king,xe2x80x9d said Represenative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana.

Coulson | Cato Institute: Commenary14 & 15.xe2x80x94 After weeks of talks, drug industry lobbyists were growing nervous. To cut a deal with the White House on overhauling health care, they needed to be sure that Presiden Obama would stop a proposal inended to bring down medicine prices. On June 3, 2009, one of the lobbyists e-mailed Nancy-An DeParle, the presidenxe2x80x99s health care adviser. Ms. DeParle reassured the lobbyist. Although Mr. Obama was overseas, she wrote, she and other top officials hadxe2x80x9cmade decision, based on how constructive you guys have been, to oppose importationxe2x80x9d on a differen proposal.Just like that, Mr. Obamaxe2x80x99s staff signaled a willingness to put aside support for the reimportation of prescription medicines at lower prices and by doing so solidified a compact with an industry the presiden had vilified on the campaign trail. Cenral to Mr. Obamaxe2x80x99s drive to remake the nationxe2x80x99s health care system was an unlikely collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry that forced unappealing trade-offs.Mr. Obamaxe2x80x99s deal-making in 2009 represened a pivotal momen in his young presidency, a juncture where the heady idealism of the campaign trail collided with the messy reality of Washington policy making. A presiden who had promised to negotiate on C-Span cut a closed-door deal with a powerful lobby, signifying to disillusioned liberal supporters a loss of inocence, or perhaps even the triumph of cynicism.htp://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/09/u...s-deal-with-industry-on-health-care.html?_r=1Click to expand...Great information but a waste of time as Obama supporters don't wan anything that refutes their opinion.

Sherman123,"SheWolf saidAnd why would you argue anisemitism was part of European culture?  I don't see any evidence of it being part of the culture or any culture at all.  It seemed to be more linked to ignorance and fear... things they couldn't conrol and didn't understand, and it was the same with women.  Jewish people and women were blamed for the Black Death, droughts, and every other frightening, explainable even people in the Middle Ages and Dark Ages couldn't understand.  I don't think that's just part of the culture, it just part of not understanding modern science, germs, and medicine.  Women and Jewish people were blamed for a number of things, and it seems common for people across all cultures behave irrationally and wrongly blame somebody or something under such circumstances.  It's also far from uncommon for modern people to not trust outsiders and foreigners, and it's obvious in America today.  That atitude will probably never change in people.But if you really wan to talk about the savagery in American history, then would you seriously and honestly just chalk it all up to American culture?Just plain old fashion American culture is to blame for slavery, genocide, the Trail of Tears, witch burnings, and decades of inequality????If you did pin slavery and witch burnings on American culture, you know how silly you would sound, right?

""Guns, Germs and Steel,"" published in 1997, has sold more than 1.5 million copies and sparked a PBS series.He said that the other author Romney cited, Harvard economist David Landes, would find Romney's thesis that culture accouns for economic differences ""dangerously out of date.Romney, speaking to a crowd -- which included GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson -- of about 40 Sunday at the famed King David Hotel, talked about why the Palestinians and Israelis had such drastically differen levels of economic developmen""And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishmens of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things,"" he said. Romney also menioned the ""hand of providence,"" and how the Jews have ""long recognized the purpose in this place and in their lives that is greater than themselves and their own particular inerests.Romney did not menion how the occupation of the Palestinian territories has severely hampered economic developmen for decades.Saeb Erekat, a senior aide to Palestinian Presiden Mahmoud Abbas, called his statemen ""racist,"" and added, ""it seems to me this man lacks information, knowledge, vision and understanding of this region and its people.While Romney may have scored poins with some right-wing Jewish voters, his remarks were another distraction from time he could be speaking about the economy, his strongest claim against Presiden Barack Obama in the presidenial electionHe repeated the argumen in a subsequen National Review article, enitled ""Culture Does Mater.""The linkage between freedom and economic developmen has a universal applicability,"" he wrote, citing the differences between East and West Germany and North and South Korea. But South Korea was an authoritarian counry unil the late 1980s, and China and Singapore are strong counerexamples to the notion that freedom and economic developmen are universally linked.This isn't the first time Romney has seemingly mischaracterized a book he's read.

Masada,"The simple fact that Romney has given 15% of his income to charity each and every year for more than a decade tells me enough.  He isn't shady about his money.  If he's avoiding taxes, he's avoiding them legally.If he's paying a lesser percenage, then he's doing so legally.I brought this up last week.  Liberals are stupid when it comes to this.  If you increase the FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE on the rich, they simply shift their earnings from personal income, to capital gains.  They move their capital and assets, LEGALLY, to realize their incomes in another fashion.  Just like Romney has done.Now, the top marginal rate for FEDERAL INCOME TAX is 35%.  While the rate for Capital Gains is 35% on short term capital gains, and 15% on long term capital gains.  Is there a liberal here, when given the choice, who would have their incomes taxed at 35%, if there was a completely legal way to realize their incomes through capital gains, and have it taxed at 15%???  If they didn't, I would call them stupid.This is precisely what Romney has done.  Which proves, when you tax the rich, they simply shift capital and assets to another vehicle, and begin to realize their incomes through capital gains and other ways.  He isn't avoiding any taxation.  He is smartly moving his money so that he can realize a larger income by having it taxed at a 15% rate, and not a 35% rate.If liberals could get past their class warfare rhetoric for 5 minutes, they would see how this is 1.  Perfectly legal, and 2.  Perfectly smart.  They would do the exact same thing with their money.  Who do they think they're kidding?Oh, and one last thing.  If you are in the 10-15% INCOME TAX BRACKET, your capital gains tax rate is 0%!!!!",40,,,Conservative

PW4000,"I wrote this as part of a response to another question, but after thinking about it, I think the topic deserves its own OP niche.Let's face it - the Right absolutely hates Barack ObamaClearly, the Right Wing Ani-Obama Machine has been out there falsifying Obama's true record since 90 days after Obama, was inaugurated.  So, you have people like Lindsey Graham, Newt Gingrich and John Sununu, taking up their strategic and tactical positions in fron of every television camera they can find, to profess all of the reasons why Presiden Obama's enire presidency is a total failure, despite facts clearly indicating otherwiseThe Right Wing venom towards the Presiden, is palpable.  The Right Wing had disdain for Presiden Clinon, but outright hate for Presiden Obama.After thinking about the mater for quite some time and geting beyond the obvious Racial Undertones that have been thrown at Obama, for the past six (6) years including two (2) years when Obama, was on the campaign trail prior to 2008, it became crystal clear to me WHY some of these people hold such spite for the Presiden.  The following is my analysis of the WHY behind the ""reason"" for Obama being hated so much by many on the RightThe Jealousy, Envy, Hate & Love ConectionThere is a special conection that this Presiden has with his most staunch supporters that I have not witessed before in Presidenial politics.  I hear more people shouting the words ""We love you!"" than I ever have when even Bill Clinon, was runing for election and/or re-election.  You hear this all the time wherever the POTUS goes.  So, there are a LOT of people out there that feel ""conected"" to the Presiden, in ways that you don't typically see in Presidenial elections.  So, the whole ""Bot"" thing just might be a bit of envy and jealousy.  You have to put that ino its proper conext - when was the last time somebody yelled to George W. Bush: ""We Love You!""  It has happened - but with Obama, it is a regular and routine occurrence, virtually everywhere he goes with his core supporters.They really do love the Presiden, and I personally think that is what creates and drives the envy and jealousy that other politicians in opposition to Obama, often express.  Most of them have been Career Politicians and probably never once had anybody tell them that they loved them from a crowd like that.  It has to be demoralizing, if you are in opposition to the Presiden, and you have been in the political sphere most of your adult life.The other thing that you have to remember about such commens like that, is the fact that you have Career men like Newt Gingrich, who not only served in the Congress a lot longer than Obama, but also atempted to gain their part's nomination more times than Obama, and failed every single time.  Up comes this ""skiny kid from Chicago,"" who spends far less time in the Senate than his opponens seeking their part's nomination, and not only gets the Democrats to nominate him, but then goes on to actually win the White House, with core supporters screaming at the top of their lungs, ""We Love You!Just think about how that makes all those Career Congressmen who could not even get their party to see them as being Presidenial enough to nominate them for the job.  It must be absolutely crushing for them to see this man sit in the White House.  Added to that, is the clear fact that he's Black and you will create some VERY angry Congressmen on the other side of the aisle, who probably feel like Obama, got to the White House on an Affirmative Action ""Scholarship"" for Potenial Black Presidenial Candidates, and not on the strength of his inelligence, articulation, command of the facts, command of the situation, command and conrol of his campaign, and his ability to step-up his game when it is absolutely necessary and pull out a victory.This is what Michael Jordan, used to always do.  Joe Monana, did the exact same thing.  And, this is the same kind of 4th quarter GOTO guy, that Obama, has become.  He gets huge wins that people remember for a long time and he gets them against the odds.  He's not a gambler, but he does take calculated risks when the risk/reward ratio warrans do so (Osama Bin Laden, as one example).He's disciplined, typically remains in conrol and has a normal aspirated demeanor that does not get blown out of proportion in difficult situations.

Jack Fabulous,"PW4000 saidI wrote this as part of a response to another question, but after thinking about it, I think the topic deserves its own OP niche.Let's face it - the Right absolutely hates Barack ObamaClearly, the Right Wing Ani-Obama Machine has been out there falsifying Obama's true record since 90 days after Obama, was inaugurated.  So, you have people like Lindsey Graham, Newt Gingrich and John Sununu, taking up their strategic and tactical positions in fron of every television camera they can find, to profess all of the reasons why Presiden Obama's enire presidency is a total failure, despite facts clearly indicating otherwiseThe Right Wing venom towards the Presiden, is palpable.  The Right Wing had disdain for Presiden Clinon, but outright hate for Presiden Obama.After thinking about the mater for quite some time and geting beyond the obvious Racial Undertones that have been thrown at Obama, for the past six (6) years including two (2) years when Obama, was on the campaign trail prior to 2008, it became crystal clear to me WHY some of these people hold such spite for the Presiden.  The following is my analysis of the WHY behind the ""reason"" for Obama being hated so much by many on the RightThe Jealousy, Envy, Hate & Love ConectionThere is a special conection that this Presiden has with his most staunch supporters that I have not witessed before in Presidenial politics.  I hear more people shouting the words ""We love you!"" than I ever have when even Bill Clinon, was runing for election and/or re-election.  You hear this all the time wherever the POTUS goes.  So, there are a LOT of people out there that feel ""conected"" to the Presiden, in ways that you don't typically see in Presidenial elections.  So, the whole ""Bot"" thing just might be a bit of envy and jealousy.  You have to put that ino its proper conext - when was the last time somebody yelled to George W. Bush: ""We Love You!""  It has happened - but with Obama, it is a regular and routine occurrence, virtually everywhere he goes with his core supporters.They really do love the Presiden, and I personally think that is what creates and drives the envy and jealousy that other politicians in opposition to Obama, often express.  Most of them have been Career Politicians and probably never once had anybody tell them that they loved them from a crowd like that.  It has to be demoralizing, if you are in opposition to the Presiden, and you have been in the political sphere most of your adult life.The other thing that you have to remember about such commens like that, is the fact that you have Career men like Newt Gingrich, who not only served in the Congress a lot longer than Obama, but also atempted to gain their part's nomination more times than Obama, and failed every single time.  Up comes this ""skiny kid from Chicago,"" who spends far less time in the Senate than his opponens seeking their part's nomination, and not only gets the Democrats to nominate him, but then goes on to actually win the White House, with core supporters screaming at the top of their lungs, ""We Love You!Just think about how that makes all those Career Congressmen who could not even get their party to see them as being Presidenial enough to nominate them for the job.  It must be absolutely crushing for them to see this man sit in the White House.  Added to that, is the clear fact that he's Black and you will create some VERY angry Congressmen on the other side of the aisle, who probably feel like Obama, got to the White House on an Affirmative Action ""Scholarship"" for Potenial Black Presidenial Candidates, and not on the strength of his inelligence, articulation, command of the facts, command of the situation, command and conrol of his campaign, and his ability to step-up his game when it is absolutely necessary and pull out a victory.This is what Michael Jordan, used to always do.  Joe Monana, did the exact same thing.  And, this is the same kind of 4th quarter GOTO guy, that Obama, has become.  He gets huge wins that people remember for a long time and he gets them against the odds.  He's not a gambler, but he does take calculated risks when the risk/reward ratio warrans do so (Osama Bin Laden, as one example).He's disciplined, typically remains in conrol and has a normal aspirated demeanor that does not get blown out of proportion in difficult situations.

PW4000,"JEthrid saidYour posts have too much proof to constitute an inelligen rebutal from conservatives (or anyone looking for facts, for that mater).  Thank you again for posting sources with your informationClick to expand...You are indeed welcome.When I make a serious OP in prose, it is mostly poined at Independen Voters - in all honesty.  Factual discourse with those in political opposition is rarely ever seen on this board and that's driven primarily by those who prefer both fictional and topical writing styles, over substanive debate on the merits, as well as the difficulty that some have with remaining inellectually honestOne of the clearest examples of that is my OP on Presiden Obama's Real Record.  Fairly early in that thread, you note MaggieD, atacking the original post but never responding to the sub-conextual causation for why Obamacare was in fact a national economic imperative, given the growing negative differenial between National Income and National Health Care Expenditures as a direct ratio of GDP.  She never responded after that because quite frankly, there is no rational, logical and/or coheren rebutal to making the atempt to drive down national healthcare expenditures as a function of common sense fiscal policy.Unfortunately, there are too many so-called ""political debate forums"" that are nothing of the sort, where as you allude to, conempt for the facts is not only tolerated, but almost a requiremen of membership.This whole Obama Presidency ""thing"" cuts against a lot of long (wrong) held beliefs systems across the counry.  One of those beliefs is that a Black Man, is incapable of leading the United States of America, much the ""same way"" that during the 1940's, no Black Man would ever have the inellectual rigor, or the heart to be a successful combat pilotBoth, Obama 44 and the Tuskegee Airmen of the 332nd, shater that notion forever.  If the cold hard truth be told, this lies at the heart of much of the anger we see today, coming from the Right.  Because, when you actually take the time to look at what the man has accomplished in fact, no one having sufficien synaptic activity and two functioning hemispheres, can or would conclude that this man's Presidency as been anything even remotely close to a failure.  The exact opposite is true given the conditions he found at play after taking office.Those are the facts.  They are not up for negotiation and history will not be re-writen on my watch.  I am a humble studen of history - not a re-writer of it.  I leave the re-writing of history up to people like Newt Gingrich and George ""at"" Will.",41,,,Cenrist
hikari,"I will say, I have heard more people hate Obama because it is the cool thing to do than I have ever heard from the right before. The left did something similar with Bush, it became the in thing to hate him, the thing is with Bush there wasn't much hatred till the wars, with Obama I remember some people vowing to do anything to obstruct him before he was even elected.To be fair I think this is due to the media news cycles ever tightening grip on people. With conservatives trying to outdo one another with much more vigor than in previous years, I don't see it geting beter and the seeds are already geting water if we have a Romney presidency expect irrational hate from the left, and they may be as obstructionist as the right have been during Obama, if that is the case no party will get anything done anymore.",41,,,

The people who seem to hate Obama are the most downright ignoran nasty self rightious people you would ever wan to meet. They are just mean and biter. You would think that obama came to each one of them and personally placed a pile of crap in their hands. There has been a lot of low brow, tasteless, racist, nasty jokes going around about him. It is not everyone, but there is a very loud minority of people who make it their life's work to hate on Obama. He touched a collective nerve of hate and bigotry I think america forgot existed. We wouild like to think that the Jersey shore and desperate housewives are all the dumbass drama queens in the world, but the radical right is downright miserable.I just hope the election ends and they can all crawl back under the rock they came from.

I got out because I simply could not tolerate the level of idiocy, racial stupidity and demagoguery being spewed by people like Newt Gingrich, John Sununu, Phil Gramm and Tren Lot, etc.  These were and are some of the most vial human beings on earth and the fact that each one of them held some of the highest offices in the land, speaks volumes about how low our society will dig in the guter, to populate the Congress with such trash.Republicans are RacistHaving said that - we have come a very long way and there is much to be optimistic about.  After all, the curren Presiden is indeed Black and the majority of voters are White.

Vallist,"why do people do this.  here is the answer your looking forFULL ANSWERThis is an example of mostly old baloney in a new casing. It mainly recycles years-old falsehoods and insinuations, most of which we covered long ago, in conection with an earlier viral email.But with Presiden Barack Obamaxe2x80x99s reelection campaign heating up, this new graphic has appeared on counless ani-Obama websites and in viral emails like the one wexe2x80x99ve reprined here. Very litle that it conains is new, and the old falsehoods have not improved with age.Nothinxe2x80x98Sealedxe2x80x99The idea that any Obama record isxe2x80x9csealedxe2x80x9d is a falsehood, to start. The wordxe2x80x9csealedxe2x80x9d when applied to documens ordinarily refers to records that would normally be public, but that a judge has ruled canot be released without the courtxe2x80x99s permission. Common examples of trulyxe2x80x9csealedxe2x80x9d documens include records of crimes commited as a juvenile or records of adoptions. None of the claims in this message refers to records actuallyxe2x80x9csealedxe2x80x9d in that usual sense.In some cases, the records this screed claims arexe2x80x9csealedxe2x80x9d are actually public, and open for anyone to see. Other supposedlyxe2x80x9csealedxe2x80x9d records are normally private documens that Obama hasnxe2x80x99t releasedxe2x80x94 and that other presidenial candidates havenxe2x80x99t released either.So as with earlier versions, this is litle more than an atempt to raise suspicions by asking for records that arenxe2x80x99t ordinarily made public, without any evidence that those records conain anything derogatory. Wexe2x80x99ll take the claims and questions in the order they appear.    Claims #1, 2 and 4, college records. Obamaxe2x80x99s college records are notxe2x80x9csealedxe2x80x9d by a court order, as this graphic would have you believe. It would be illegal under federal law (the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974) for Occidenal, Columbia or Harvard Law School to give any former studenxe2x80x99s records to reporters or members of the public without that personxe2x80x99s specific, writen permission. Obama hasnxe2x80x99t released them, but neither have other presidenial candidates released their college records. George W. Bushxe2x80x99s grades at Yale evenually became public, but only because somebody leaked them to the New Yorker magazine. Bush himself refused to release them, according to a 1999 profile in the Washington Post    Claim #3, thesis paper. Obama did write a paper on nuclear disarmamen for an honors course in American foreign policy during his senior year, but it wasnxe2x80x99t the sort ofxe2x80x9cthesisxe2x80x9d that some colleges require for graduation and keep on file in their libraries, like those that Hillary Clinon and Michelle Obama released. During the 2008 campaign, reporters were told that Columbia had not retained a copy of Obamaxe2x80x99s 1983 paper, and that Obama didnxe2x80x99t have a copy, either. NBC News conacted his former professor, Michael Baron, who said he looked for his copy but couldnxe2x80x99t find it, and thought he probably tossed it out eight years earlier in a move.    NBC quoted Baron as saying the paper likely would have disappoined Obamaxe2x80x99s critics.xe2x80x9cThe course was not a polemical course, it was a course in decision making and how decisions got made,xe2x80x9d Baron told NBC.xe2x80x9cNone of the papers in the class were conroversial.xe2x80x9d    Claim #5, Selective Service registration. Obamaxe2x80x99s Selective Service registration is public. A copy has been posted publicly, and the Selective Service confirmed that Obama registered for the draft on Sept. 4, 1980, and was given registration number 61-1125539-1.    Worth noting is that nobody in the U.S. has been drafted for military service since 1972, the year Obama turned 11. Obama, like other young men turning age 18 since then, was required to register on a standby basis, in case Congress ever resumes an active military draft. Failure to register is technically a crime, and disqualifies a man for federal studen aid or from holding certain federal jobs.    Claim #6, medical records. During the 2008 campaign, Obama released summary medical information from his personal physician, who pronounced him to be inxe2x80x9cexcellen healtxe2x80x9d with routine test results for such things as cholesterol all within normal levels. (McCain, who is a cancer survivor and was 71 at the time, let reporters see his records for three hours to show he was cancer-free.    Since taking office, Obama has followed the practice of earlier presidens. He released results of his firstxe2x80x9cperiodicxe2x80x9d physical exam on Feb. 28, 2010. Results of his seconxe2x80x9cperiodicxe2x80x9d exam were released Oct. 31, 2011. His physician described him as beinxe2x80x9cin excellen health anxe2x80x98fit for duty.xe2x80x99xe2x80x9d    Claims #7 and 8, Illinois state Senate records. Obamaxe2x80x99s voting record in the Illinois state Senate is a mater of public record, and about as far from beinxe2x80x9csealedxe2x80x9d as one can imagine. Reporters extensively wen over his votes in 2008.  Transcripts of Senate debates in which Obama took part while in office (1997xe2x80x93 2004) can even be found online, at the website of the Illinois General Assembly.    Obamaxe2x80x99s personal appoinmen calendar as a state senator may still be privatxe2x80x94 if it still existxe2x80x94 but wexe2x80x99ve seen nothing to suggest that would add much to what is already public. As presiden, Obama has released records of visitors to the White House (2.4 million so far). There are some exceptions. Personal information about visitors, such as Social Security numbers are not released. And therexe2x80x99s an exemption forxe2x80x9cparticularly sensitivexe2x80x9d information, which might include a visit by a potenial Supreme Court nominee, for example. But thatxe2x80x99s still more disclosure than any previous presiden has made, by far.    Claim #9, law firm cliens. Itxe2x80x99s true that Obama has not released a list of the 30 or so cliens for whom he worked personally while he was a lawyer with the firm of Davis, Miner, Barnhill and Gallard in Illinois. He did routinely disclose the law firmxe2x80x99s enire clien list while he was in the state Senate, however. And his campaign confirmed in 2008 several specific cliens that Obama represened personally, when reporters asked about them. For example, he once represened the liberal group ACORN in a 1995 lawsuit against the state of Illinois, to make voter registration easier.    Claims #10 and 11, birth certificates. The claim that Obamaxe2x80x99s birth certificate isxe2x80x9csealedxe2x80x9d is pure nonsense. Copies of both the so-calledxe2x80x9cshortxe2x80x9d anxe2x80x9clonxe2x80x9d certificates have been released, and state officials in Hawaii have said repeatedly that Obama was born there in 1961 and is axe2x80x9cnatural born American citizenxe2x80x9d    Claim #12, baptism record. If a paper record exists (and wexe2x80x99ve seen no evidence that it does), it would most likely show only what numerous, undisputed news accouns have stated: Obama was baptized in 1988 in Rev. Jeremiah Wrightxe2x80x99s Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago. Obama was often seen in atendance at Wrightxe2x80x99s church in the 20 years that followed. He was married there, and his two daughters were baptized there.    He remained a member even after some of Wrightxe2x80x99s conroversial sermons were given national atenion in early 2008. When Obama reluctanly severed ties with Wright after weeks of conroversy, it was a major news even. Obama and his family now atend St. Johnxe2x80x99s Episcopal Church, near the White House, though not on a regular basis.    Claim #13: Michelle Obamaxe2x80x99s law license. Itxe2x80x99s simply not true that the first ladyxe2x80x9ccan no longer practice law as an atorney.xe2x80x9d She could resume the practice of law any time she chooses. Both the presiden and his wife have volunarily inactivated their Illinois law licenses, thereby avoiding a requiremen to take coninuing education classes and pay hundreds of dollars in anual fees, which is common for lawyers no longer actively practicing.    Claim #14, first ladiesxe2x80x99 assistans. Itxe2x80x99s true that the first lady has more than 20 on her staff, but thatxe2x80x99s roughly the same as other recen first ladies. The claim thatxe2x80x9cother first ladies had only onxe2x80x9d might conceivably be true of Martha Washington or Dolley Madison, but itxe2x80x99s certainly not true of Laura Bush or Hillary Clinon. Bush had at least 18 that we could coun, and probably more with job titles that didnxe2x80x99t make the link clear. The White House has said Michelle Obamaxe2x80x99s staff is the same size as Laura Bushxe2x80x99s was.    Claim #15, foreign studen aid. The claim that Obama gotxe2x80x9cforeign studen aidxe2x80x9d is unrue. That wild falsehood began as an absurd April Foolsxe2x80x99 Day hoax in 2009, which we quickly exposed.    Claim #16, Obamaxe2x80x99s passport. Therexe2x80x99s no reason to think Obama used anything but the then-curren version of his U.S. passport when he traveled to Pakistan as a studen in 1981. Some who questioned Obamaxe2x80x99s birthplace made baseless claims that Pakistan had baned U.S. citizens from visiting in 1981, and speculated that he must have used an Indonesian passport. But they were quite wrong. There was no such travel ban. In fact, the New York Times published a travel piece that year describing the authorxe2x80x99s own visit to Lahore, and the U.S. consul later wrote a leter to the Times saying he wouldxe2x80x9cwelcome an influx of Americanxe2x80x9d and giving advice on how to make the journey.Other ClaimsBesides the numbered claims, the graphic also states that Obama has been endorsed by the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). Itxe2x80x99s true that the Communist Party USA supports Obama. It claims to have about 2,000 members. Obama didnxe2x80x99t seek the CPUSA endorsemen, nor has he endorsed that group.The graphic also atributes three quotes to Obama, all of which are commonly offered on conservative websites. All the quotes are accurate. Herexe2x80x99s the backgroun    Obama appeared at the Service Employees Inernational Union Sept. 17, 2007, to seek the unionxe2x80x99s endorsemen for the Democratic nomination, and he said,xe2x80x9cyour agenda has been my agenda in the United States Senate.xe2x80x9d (The words appear at about 3 minutes and 15 seconds ino this video.) And the SEIU evenually endorsed Obama, but not unil February 2008, helping him wrap up the nomination batle against Hillary Clinon. The union has endorsed him again for reelection    At the 2008 National Council of La Raza anual meeting in San Diego, Calif., on July 13, 2008, Obama concluded his remarks by saying,xe2x80x9cAnd together, we wonxe2x80x99t just win an electionxe2x80x93 we will transform this nation. Thank you, and God bless you.xe2x80x9d    And speaking to the editorial board of the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 17, 2008, Obama said electricity costs wouldxe2x80x9cnecessarily skyrocketxe2x80x9d as a result of capping carbon emissions. However, the cap-and-trade legislation he endorsed provided allowances inended to protect consumers from higher bills.In summary, there are bits here that are true. But most is wrong or misleading, and overall the graphic falls far short of geting our seal of approval for accuracy.

Obama shouldn't bring it up and make it an issue, if it is not hurting him in anyway.If anybody should make that challenge, it should be Romney.  Cause NOBODY has challenged Obama to release the info, not quite like Obama has been atacking Romney on releasing his tax returns.Obama has the upper hand, so don't expect him to put his ass on the table to mock Romney that much more.

Then terrain and vegitation or stuctures would have to be considered.  Building tops can be an advanage or disadvanage.  Then your assets, what troops and where.  It sounds like it would definately require boots on the ground to handle this situation.  Time is I think the biggie.  I really don know how close mission capable ground troops were, neither does fox news.  this is a completely conrived outrage.  If it does affect the election, Romney owes his election to fox news.  I would like to think most Americans were smart enough not to fall for this, but I have lost faith in thatMasada saidDamn right I'm pushing to influence the election.  Because when I see a Commander in Chief respond to an atack this way, then lie his ass off for weeks in order to cover it up just so he can win an election, you're damn right I'm going to try to change some minds.You wana call them ""delusions"", then by all means, stay in your own delusional world and vote Man Child, maybe he can claim credit for popping your cherry too, like he does in his latest ad campaign.....Click to expand...",44,Male,Indian,

The motives of the terrorists can't be reduced from the motives of the protests they overtook because the two blend together. What exactly motivated the terrorists will probably be in the report'm also curious what exactly Obama is trying to obscure by means of this ""lie."" That terrorists were involved? He can't hide that because the protesters had explosives. It would take some sort of hostile military network to acquire those.He can't, especially as the truth trickles outHe made it worse by lying in an atempt to cover it up.On 911, a terror atack, that simply didn't jibe with his don't say terrorist world view.You can believe it or not... but why hasn't he called terrorists terrorists?
