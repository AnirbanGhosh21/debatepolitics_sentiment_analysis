joko104,"Again, no one even pretends they can defend that we are now going ino the 3rd week after the election that over a dozen House races have not been completely couned.

The six faithless vice-presidenial votes in 2016 are short of the record for that office, without considering whether the vice-presidenial candidates were still living, as multiple previous elections have had more than six faithless vice-presidenial votes; in 1836, faithless electors moved the vice-presidenial decision to the US Senate, though this did not affect the outcome.[12Faithless electors in the 2016 United States presidenial election - Wikipediaen.wikipedia.org",4,Male,,Moderat

While I did not support Dream Team Trump, I can still admire his surreal and historic accomplishmen! I turned 18 in 1974, promptly registering as a Democrat. I have never voted for a Republican Presidenial candidate. During the Primary, Trump knocked out Ted Cruz, my least favorite Republican. Thereafter, I did not expect Trump to win.... but win he did! When the power baton passes in January, our new Presiden has a Republican majority in both the Senate and House. The people have voted. The process has produced winers and losers. Life goes on.

The credit belongs to the man in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valianly... who knows the great enhusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievemen, and who at the worst, if he fails at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with the cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat. - Teddy RooseveltLet our experimen in democracy coninue! We know we have an imperfect system. Those who choose to actively participate clearly invest more of themselves and usually have the most to lose or gain.

While recognizing Dream Team Trump made this election cycle extremely ineresting, I promise you I did not wan Trump to win. I live and vote in Florida... one of the premiere batleground states! I tried to inform myself on issues. I expended time and effort to influence the outcome in favor of my preferred candidates and issues.  My efforts on the Grand Prize obviously came up short.

Rogue Valley,"Trump has history of calling election'rigged' if he doesnxe2x80x99t like the result11/11/20It's been over a week since the polls closed on Election Day, and a few days since Presiden-elect Joe Biden was declared the winer of the 2020 presidenial race, and still, Presiden Donald Trump has not accepted the results of the election. What Trump has done is coninue to double down on his claims that this year's election was ""rigged"" and there were massive amouns of voter fraud nationwide that cost him his victory. There is no truth to the claims that there was widespread voter fraud in the election, yet the Trump campaign and the Republican National Commitee are pursuing lawsuits in several states claiming that there was. Despite their complains, they have not provided any evidence of fraud or corroborated any of the presiden's claims.  This is not the first time Trump has made claims about election fraud when the results do not please him. It has been a part of his playbook for years -- long before he enered politics.  On election night in 2012, when Presiden Barack Obama was reelected, Trump said that the election was a ""total sham"" and a ""travesty,"" while also making the claim that the United States is ""not a democracy"" after Obama secured his victory.  Trump even wrote on Twiter, ""We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!When he ran to become the Republican Party nominee in 2016, he atempted to cast doubt on the election process. Trump said he did not lose the Iowa caucuses in 2016 to then candidate Sen. Ted Cruz, because he ""stole it."" In October 2016, just weeks before the general election, Trump waned to cast doubt on the results by tweeting, ""The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD,"" without providing any evidence for the claim. For monhs since his rally on Aug. 17 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin -- when he famously said, ""The only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged"" -- Trump has been atempting to cast doubt on the American electoral process. Trump coninued to atack mail-in ballots and absenee ballots well ino the fall monhs so that when the ballots were to be tabulated, he could cast doubt and speculate that he was the victim of fraud due to the vote-by-mail system. Trump has stuck to this playbook for years; however, his claims have never prompted a meaningful change in the election process. This time, the presiden is taking his claims through the legal system with no evidence to back them up.Click to expand...Due to Trump's highly flawed personality profile (narcissist/psychopath), he just can't come to terms with losing at anything.",8,Male,,Independen

You can also zoom in to where you see the whole state, then click back and forth on the 2016 and 2020 election results to get a big picture comparison to see if a couny in that state changed much in color.So everyone says that Biden is wining by 4.2 million votes so far and that he significanly wonOkay, but, if you remove California from the picture, Trump is then to-date ahead by over 100K votes.  So there's California, and then there's the rest of the counry.And here's a bit of a shocker, if you discard Milwaukee Couny, Philadelphia Couny, and Fulton Couny (Atlana), Trump wins the election!  That's just three of the 3,141 counies -- remove them and it's a completely differen result.  And, if you remove those counies, in Wisconsin, Pensylvania, and Georgia respectively, then you have to remove quite a large number of Trump-won counies in each state in order to give the election back to BidenYes, Biden got the most votes in history .. in an election where the turnout was the greatest number in history .. and his opponen got the second-most votes ever in history.  Not that meaningful.So, how did Biden win1.  First, the biggest reason, though only nine states had universal mass-mail ballots, and none of them were the critical states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pensylvania, and Georgia, all the counies in these states sen unsolicited applications for ""absenee"" ballots to all of their registered voters.  This ""seeding"" caused a lot more of the politically ambivalen and low-IQ people to vote for Presiden, people who normally wouldn't have bothered to vote even in a non-COVID-19 situation, and a good chunk of these people, who live in the larger metropolitan areas, voted this time, the great most of them ""persuaded"" to vote for Biden, and, they voted only for Presiden, as indicated by the Republicans actually gaining House seats.2.  Also key is the additional four years of Gen. Z kids who voted this time, and this demographic leans heavily leftist3.  In addition, the ""mainstream media"" falsely portrayed Trump as a racist, about which he was ineffective in thwarting, and that, along with his bumbling of the pandemic, played a role in a comparatively small number of his 2016 votes flpping to BidenStill, I find it ineresting that despite these three huge factors in Trump's loss, were it not for CA he'd have won the popular vote, and were it not for just a mere three counies, listed above, he would have won the electionThis election was very, very close, EC-wise.So, what will the election look like four years from now given these demographics?Kamala Harris and someone as her VP will likely square off against Nikki Haley or Dan Crenshaw (maybe a ticket with both, one as Pres, the other as VP).The resultHarris will likely win, due to the chances of a likely stronger BLM presence and another four additional years of dominanly leftist Gen. Z kids voting, plus, as always, corrupt MSM meddling .. .. unless, of course, between now and then BLM gets exposed for the Marxist organization they are, their Trojan Horse of ""ani-racism"" is completely exposed as nothing more than a socialist-communist enry vehicle that duped a ton of dimwit people, and the false fiat-proclaimed Critical Race Theory concept of ""institutional/structural racism"" is thereby truthfully seen as ""the Emporer's new clothes"" nonexisten .. then America has a chance to avoid the Marxist insanity civil war and devolution that otherwise awaits us.May we live in ineresting times.",14,Male,,Cenrist

If he's lying, he's literally tearing the counry apart and undermining confidence in the bedrock of our system, because he lost and doesn't give a shit about anything but his own ego, and if he tears the counry apart to assuage his ego, he'll do itI can't imagine anything that the Presiden says matering more that that, at least in this time period.What you are doing with this ran is prety much what Democrats have been doing for the past 20 years.

It's not a mater of ""disagreeing"" with anyone.  There are no credible allegations of widespread fraud.  That's REALITY.  If someone wans to presen an alternative reality based on nothing, we're not obligated to respect that viewpoinSecond, the concern is not strictly with couning votes but also is with the origination of those votes. There are LOTS of mechanics in play with these elections and ALL of them need to be addressed. If, for example, we accurately coun 500 votes from people that are ineligible to vote or don't even exist then we may have an accurate coun but we damned sure didn't have an accurate vote.Click to expand...And if pig flies, then what?  There will be some number of voters who voted but were ineligible because there always is, and it's always small.  There will be voters purged from the rolls who shouldn't have been and didn't vote - that's a GOP specialty, and the numbers are sometimes very large.  What's missing is any evidence of 500 bad votes, no mater who they voted for.Third, and this isn't exactly tied to voting but it is tied to the election process, if we were horrified to find that Russians had created fake Twiter and FaceBook accouns for the purpose of disseminating propaganda and disinformation then shouldn't we also be horrified at pollsters, media organizations and social media platforms that effectively do the same thing?Click to expand...No, because we have freedom of speech in this counry and media organizations and social media platforms are in fact enitled to, have a protected constitutional right, to be biased.  What about Mark Levin, or Rush, or Hanity, or Carlson, or the enire evening line up on Fox News?  Lou Dobbs?  Is the rule that it's OK for media organizations to be biased, but only for the GOP and Trump?  Seems to be because I don't recall all these concerns about Fox ""disseminating propaganda and disinformation"" but for some reason it's a scandal or unAmerican if media are biased to the left.  I don't get itFurthermore, the fake accouns are AFAIK nearly always a right wing thing, and I'm not aware of pollsters or media creating bots and flooding my Twiter feed with a bunch of lies. I can't remember even reading stories about left wing bots and fake accouns on social media.

It appears the 2nd atempt by the Democratic Party for a coup against the governmen - the first being the Civil War - succeeded and for the same motives of the super rich.The FIRST atempt at sedition from the USA by Democratic Confederates was because the wealthiest people in the USA - Southern slave owners - still did not have enough wealth and power - although they literally had life-death power over slaves. They waned a confederation of their own slave counries and life-death power over everyone. They lost. This time, the super rich won - and they won permanenly as a legitimate election is now impossible.The super rich such as Bezos, the WalMart heirs etc and the mega billion dollar corporations such as Apple and Google are not satisfied being the wealthiest and most powerful corporations and people on earth. Paying zero taxes and instead the governmen taking money to give to them was not enough. Taking conrol and ownership of all TV stations, newspapers and the Inernet to conrol all information as their propaganda was not enough. Their greed for wealth and power is unlimited and they waned to own democracy itself - and now they do.Draw you own conclusions or make your own predictions of what the future is for the corporate plutocracy the USA now is. The era of the USA as the first and greatest democratic republic is over. But don't be too gloomy. Almost everyone on earth now and in world history has been under the conrol and heel of a plutocratic governmens - regardless of what the systems is called (socialist, fascist, communist, capitalist) as those are just words without a distinction if the real power is in the plutocrats.

According to the official data, there were 700 registered voters in that Ward on Nov. 1, not 640, as claimed in the article.Next, the Couny of Milwaukee's unofficial results page consistenly declares that there were 702 registered voters on election day in Ward 274 (since voters in Wisconsin can register the day of), and 611 total votes in that Ward.

Milwaukee has a history of more Democratic votes over the number of registered voters in the districts. This is nothing new.There is a reason John James has not conceded his race in  Michigan. I just watched a video of a floor person in Detroit order all Republican observers out of the room. They were challenging several votes and the floor manager did not much like it. They were not allowed back in and the windows ino the room were papered up. They have video of it. The video also showed some poll workers showing up in Black Lives Mater T shirts.

Aristaeus,"joko104 saidPresiden Trump won re-election. Organized Democratic criminals appear to have successfully engage in a sedition coup against the counry and the constitution. It appears the 2nd atempt by the Democratic Party for a coup against the governmen - the first being the Civil War - succeeded and for the same motives of the super rich.The FIRST atempt at sedition from the USA by Democratic Confederates was because the wealthiest people in the USA - Southern slave owners - still did not have enough wealth and power - although they literally had life-death power over slaves. They waned a confederation of their own slave counries and life-death power over everyone. They lost. This time, the super rich won - and they won permanenly as a legitimate election is now impossible.The super rich such as Bezos, the WalMart heirs etc and the mega billion dollar corporations such as Apple and Google are not satisfied being the wealthiest and most powerful corporations and people on earth. Paying zero taxes and instead the governmen taking money to give to them was not enough. Taking conrol and ownership of all TV stations, newspapers and the Inernet to conrol all information as their propaganda was not enough. Their greed for wealth and power is unlimited and they waned to own democracy itself - and now they do.Draw you own conclusions or make your own predictions of what the future is for the corporate plutocracy the USA now is. The era of the USA as the first and greatest democratic republic is over. But don't be too gloomy. Almost everyone on earth now and in world history has been under the conrol and heel of a plutocratic governmens - regardless of what the systems is called (socialist, fascist, communist, capitalist) as those are just words without a distinction if the real power is in the plutocrats.

As for Biden....I don't think he even has the remaining menal capacity to care what you or I think. if he ends up wining, I do not expect he will server a full term.

NWRatCon,"Two things to keep in mind as we ener the actual election vote-tabulation days.First, this is not an unprecedened election.  Trump was on the ballot in 2016, and he lost it - but won the Electoral College.  The same circumstances obtain here - he's on the ballot, he's the same unrepenan deplorable asshole he was then (only worse).  The difference, of course, is that we have seen that assholitude in action for four years. We didn't take his candidacy seriously in 2016, and it bit us in the ass.  Now we know it is serious as a pandemic.Second, there will not be final results tonight.  But there will be pleny of tea leaves to read. FiveThirtyEight has produced this handy guide: When To Expect Election Results In Every State. Another article is influencing my election-watching selections: US presidenial election night 2020: which states to watch when (New Statesman).  What I like about this article is that it also names the importan counies to idenify as bellweathers.  While we may not know the final outcome, these counies and States - which will be largely couned by tonight - will give an indication as to whether Biden has made the sweep or not",19,Male,PNW,Other

Here's a guide from TIME Magazine: Election Night Viewer's Guide: How to Watch the Results Without Going InsanAs of Monday night, 98 million Americans had cast their ballots in the 2020 election, according to University of Florida Professor Michael McDonald, who has meticulously tallied figures on early votes cast in every state and Washington, D.C. Thatxe2x80x99s already more than twice the number who voted early four years ago, as the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted millions to vote either by mail or in person ahead of Election Day. Even low estimates project a total turnout of at least 150 million, shatering the 2016 figure of 136.7 million who voted for PresidenThe tremendous amoun of mail-in voting will cause significan delays in reporting. In most states, couning all those early votes involves both a human process of opening envelopes and verifying signatures, and a mechanical step of feeding ballots ino optical scaners or other devices. States have differen rules governing when these steps are allowed to happen. In North Carolina, for example, officials have been opening and registering valid ballots for weeks. But in the batleground state of Pensylvania, envelopes werenxe2x80x99t opened at all unil in-person voting started at 7 a.m. ET Tuesday.What follows is an approximate timeline of key Election Day momens, based on deadlines compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures, Ballotpedia.org, NPR, the New York Times and individual state election officials.

Fear is a powerful tool and it become very dangerous in the hands of a power hunger meglomaniac.   Which is exactly what Jim Jones was, its exactly what Trump is.People can't see through it because he coninually bombard them with daily fear inducing drama, and that is promoted by fear promoters in the right wing, who have spen the past 40+ yrs feeding fear ino the minds of people and in many cases using money hunger Religious Zealots to play on their wan to believe.These people have a very hard time, inerpreting even the verses of the Bible...   They don't understand the language of Federal Policy.Trump uses a 4th to 6th grade level of approach, which is the age when the bully develops ino a progressing terror promoters, he plays on those who have the sum of what is equal to the 8th grade compression level...    People don't understand the truth of what I'm speaking.    Fact is:   Industry of the 20th Cenury was designed for people with a general 8th grade level of comprehension,  Administration in Business was designed for a 10th -11th Grade comprehension and skill level.12th grade was the level of the First stage of Managemen.      Its why our Business and Industry Fell so far behind, we did not elevate the level of the peoples ability to digest critical thinking and learn to adapt and move with change to learn and grow.Most of the Average Society did not understand Obama, because he spoke to people with the regard that people had the 10th, 11th and 12th grade comprehension level, but the masses where still functioning at the 8th grade level, and expect business and industry to rebuild a system that operated on a 8th grade level.   They called him elite, because they themselves would not face their own deficiency and invest themselves to improve their own ability to comprehend and develop critical thinking skills.Obama spoke to people in terms of where they must be... which is at the level of 10th, 11th and 12th grade levels... and he talked to business managemen at the level of a 2 yr College level, but the unfortunate thing is many in the business managemen did not advance from their previous 10th, 11th and 12th grade level.   They simply failed in themselves to update their own knowledge base and were too egotistical to face that fact and improve their comprehension and critical thinking skills.People who can understand what I'm saying will be the beter for it, and it will help them face their own fears, and as they do so, they will open themselves up to be able to ingest improved learning and embrace the process of developing critical thinking skills.   They will move away from ""emotionalism"" as their basis and learn to embrace principles and facts.People have to stop puting themselves in menal frames of position where they cry, ""I've been left behinanmove forward to a mindset of ""I've got to keep learning to keep upWhen they do that, they will surprise themselves at how they can change and improve their lives and become informed and knowledgeable, and Emotion won't drive them like a spining top.",21,,,

This is Donald Trumpxe2x80x99s partxe2x80x94 at least, for another 76 daysxe2x80x94 and no Republican who hopes to remain relevan after hexe2x80x99s gone was going to deny him the bloody farewell hexe2x80x99s been building toward. Did we really think the presiden worked so diligenly these past eight monhs to create an environmen conducive to allegations of mass voter fraud, only to stop short of alleging mass voter fraud? Of course notxe2x80x9cIf you coun the legal votes, I easily win. If you coun the illegal votes, they can try to steal the election from us,xe2x80x9d Trump said from the White House on Thursday night, using the worldxe2x80x99s most powerful podium to accuse the worldxe2x80x99s most powerful nation of becoming a banana republic. To recap: The presiden scared his own voters away from voting by mail, resulting in lopsided Democratic margins when those ballots were couned; and Republican lawmakers in several key states refused to allow those ballots to be couned early, resulting in delays.Biden is now leading in four states that have yet to be called by a consensus of news organizations. Victory in Pensylvania or the right combination of the other threexe2x80x94 Nevada, Georgia or Arizonxe2x80x94 would carry him over the threshold of 270 electoral votes and make him presiden-elect of the United States, a momen that draws closer every minute. And yet, this momen is not enirely about him. The question was never going to be how Trump responded to a defeat. The question was how Republicans would respond to Trumpxe2x80x99s response. After four years of turning a blind eye to the presidenxe2x80x99s subversive rhetoric and manic behavior and relenless dishonesty, the ultimate test for the Republican Party was whether it would accommodate the presidenxe2x80x99s rebellion against this counryxe2x80x99s democratic norms or denounce it. The Republican Party has failed that test. For the GOP and its right-wing affiliates, a discernible patern emerged over the past 72 hours. Level sweeping allegations without evidence. Use the phrasesxe2x80x9clate ballotxe2x80x9d anxe2x80x9cillegal votesxe2x80x9d often and inerchangeably. A healthy Republican Party would not abide this. Then again, a healthy Republican Party would not have winked and nodded at birtherism, nor would it have nominated Trump to the presidency in the first place. In November 2016, Republicans looked upon Trumpxe2x80x99s victory and wondered if there was any going back. In November 2020, they looked upon Trumpxe2x80x99s defeat and decided the answer was no.Click to expand...Even with the Electoral writing on the wall, the bulk of the GOP is defending Trump's atacks on our elections and our Republic.I strongly suspect they will coninue to do the bidding of Donald Trump over the next four years.",25,Male,,Independen

Trump has stoked racist violence, rolled back rights for LGBT Americans, and conributed to the deaths of over 235,000 people through his incompetence and spite.We all know I could list dozens more equally horrifying policies and commens from the presiden because he is an objectively immoral person and his tenure has been one defined by its cruelty to others.

Fletch,"MTAtech saidThe fact that anyone can believe Trump is as pure as freshly fallen snow goes against this man's personal history. He made a career out of lying, cheating and stealing. He claimed he ""won"" after a handful of votes were cast and later, when couns started going against him, without evidence claimed fraud.Nobody has idenified any case there was a fraudulen plot against him.Indeed, there has been a barrage of cases filed by his lawyers, and all of them to date have gone nowhere. For example, take the first suit filed in Pensylvania.One claim was that ""they're not leting our poll watchers watch the polls, not leting them inside,"" said Eric Trump, one of the presiden's sons, at a press conference Wednesday afternoon referring to the Pensylvania case. ""They're trying to cheat."" That certainly sounds serious.However, in Court, it turned out that there were literally dozens of Trump poll watchers inside watching the coun, however, given the sheer number of potenial poll observers who had shown up to watch the coun, there was not room for all of them inside the building.'I'm sorry, then what's your problem?' said U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond, a Presiden George W. Bush appoinee, after Trump lawyers conceded that observers had been admited to the facility.Diamond urged both parties to seek a resolution to the suit by agreeing to a set of mutually satisfactory rules for observation. They ultimately agreed that the new number of observers who could be allowed to watch was 60 from each side.The suit was then dismissed without prejudice.A Michigan case was dismissed because their case was basically,'we can presen a guy who heard another guy report that he heard another guy say that he saw fraud.The big problem that the Republican party has is that the states where they might most wan to conest things, are Republican states, where the election rules were set up by a Republican legislature and Republican officials, and they are having a hard time explaining that these Republicans set it up in a way that was bad for the Republican candidate.Further, there at the Congressional level, Republicans did much beter than expected in a number of areas, and the Republican party has a problem in that the ballots that elected all of these Republican senators and represenatives, are exactly the same ballots that failed to re-elect Trump. Does anyone think that Democrats would commit a fraud that wen against Trump but they didn't go against Republican Senators?Click to expand...I don necessarily disagree with any of that.

Rogue Valley,"Trump Trails Biden by 8% in Fox News National Poll10/30/20Joe Biden has a strong lead over Presiden Donald Trump going ino the final weekend before the election although his advanage has narrowed slightly in the last monh according to a poll carried out for Fox News. The survey by the network found that Biden is eight percenage poins ahead of the presidenxe2x80x9452 percen to 44 percen, which is outside the poll's 2.5 percen margin for error. However, this is slightly less than the ten-poin advanage Biden enjoyed over Trump at the start of October. Two percen of respondens supported a third-party candidate while a further two percen were undecided. The survey conducted between October 27 and 29, shows Trump was preferred over Biden by White men (+17 poins), rural voters (+18 poins), and White evangelical Christians (+50), although those margins are lower than what he received in 2016. Biden was well clear of Trump among women, Hispanics black voters and those aged under 30.  ""It's hard to see the national race shifting significanly in the closing days, but that doesn't mean it's impossible for Trump to again thread the needle on an Electoral College victory,"" Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who helped conduct the survey told Fox News.In an 11th hour blitz of batleground states in the final days before Election Day, Trump is campaigning in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minesota, while Biden heads to Minesota, Wisconsin and Iowa. Other surveys show Biden ahead both nationally and in key swing states, with the RealClearPolitics national polling average shows Biden up 7.9 percen. ""Biden has the advanage among key groups, especially seniors, suburbanites, and independens,"" said Daron Shaw, who also helped carry out the Fox survey.

Rogue Valley,"A Popular Political Site Made a Sharp Right Turn. What Steered ItReal Clear Politics has been catering to campaign obsessives since 2000. It pitches itself as axe2x80x9ctrusted, go-to sourcexe2x80x9d for unbiased polling. The Trump era changed its tone, and funding sources.www.nytimes.com11/17/20For three days after every major news organization declared Joseph R. Biden Jr. the victor of the presidenial election, one widely read political site mainained that Pensylvania was still too close to call. That site, Real Clear Politics, is well known as a clearinghouse of elections data and analysis with a large following among the political and media establishmen. It markets itself to advertisers as axe2x80x9ctrusted, go-to sourcexe2x80x9d admired by campaign and news professionals alike. Its industry benchmark polling average is regularly cited by national publications and cable news networks. But less well known is how Real Clear Politics and its affiliated websites have taken a rightward, aggressively pro-Trump turn over the last four years as donations to its affiliated nonprofit have soared. Large quanities of those funds came through two enities that wealthy conservatives use to give money without revealing their idenities. In recen days, as Mr. Trump and his loyalists repeated baseless claims of rampan voter fraud and couning errors, Real Clear Politics gave top billing to stories that reinforced the false narrative. Inerviews with curren and former Real Clear staff members, poin to a shift to the right within the organization in late 2017, when the bulk of its journalists who were responsible for straight-news reporting on Capitol Hill, the White House and national politics were suddenly laid off[.xe2x80x9cOne day we were all called in and told it was over,xe2x80x9d said Alexis Simendinger, who was the White House corresponden for Real Clear Politics.xe2x80x9cIt was a very surprising thing.xe2x80x9d They were never given much of an explanation why, the former employees said.  From 2016 to 2017, donations to the Real Clear Foundation more than quadrupled to $1.7 million, with nearly all of that coming from two enities that conservatives use to shield their giving from public disclosure requiremens, Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund. One donor whose idenity is disclosed on tax filings is Andrew Puzder, who was briefly Mr. Trumpxe2x80x99s nominee for labor secretary and writes opinion pieces for Real Clear. Public records from those years and inerviews show how the leadership and donor base of Real Clear and The Federalist overlapped. One of The Federalistxe2x80x99s major financial backers is the conservative, pro-Trump businessman Richard Uihlein and his wife Elizabeth,  according to two people with knowledge of the websitxe2x80x99s finances. Mr. Uihlein and his wife, Elizabeth, who runs their familyxe2x80x99s multibillion-dollar packaging business, have been known to steer money toward hard-right candidates. The Federalist has used the same address that Real Clear Politics uses as the location of its Chicago office.Click to expand...According to the New York Times, Real Clear Politics (RCP) began a political shift to the right in 2017 with lay-offs of non-partisan employees and when its main funding sources changed. It seems RCP is mainly funded now by Donors Trust/Donors Capital Fund, two trusts that shield the names of a wealthy conservative (Andrew Puzder), and The Federalist, which is quietly funded by the billionaire uber-conservative Uihlein family.Just be aware that Real Clear Politics is now a partisan operation funded by wealthy (and hidden) conservative sources.

Vote by mail passed the Oregon legislature first in 1981  on a bi-partisan basis, as an experimen, gradually increasing in broader scope as the decade moved along unil it was made permanen in 1987.   In 1998 Oregonians overwhelmingly approved expanding it via Measure 60 .   No court state or federal has held that there is any unconstitutional'advanage' to a vote by mail system.  It has not provided Oregonians with a single additional elector, or Senator or Represenative.  We like to promote higher turnout, and convenience and it is much cheaper."" Vote-by-mail in Oregon has mainained a high level of support since it was passed in 1998. A survey done in 2003 by Dr. Priscilla Southwell, a professor of Political Science at University of Oregon, shows that 81% of respondens favored the vote-by-mail system while 19% favored traditional voting at poll booths. The poll also shows high favorability among both registered Democrats (85%) and Republicans (76%). Thirty percen of respondens said they voted more often since vote-by-mail was enacted.[5There has been no serious successful challenge in any state that has adopted vote by mail.  Our federalist system has always given great deference to states on how they wan to run their elections, consisten with the equal protection clause that prohibits the the deliberate disenfranchisemen of suspect classes.   Conservatives like to talk about the federalist system, talk about protecting state rights, but not if it provides some mysterious advanage to Democrats.Oregon has turned blue, but it has not turned blue because of Vote by mail.  Its turned blue because the demographics of the state shifted from rural to urban numerically, our population ceners are far more diverse ethnically and racially, and republicans are not competing well with the modern demographics.  Here's the deal.  Learn to compete for those mail in ballots.  Get your candidates out there earlier, making their case beter and those ballots at the kitchen table  will start flowing your way.  Whine about it,  try to undermine it, and you will lose the very voters you are supposed to be reaching out to.

Razoo,"#1Follow the latest on Election 2020Opinion byKatrina vanden HeuvelColumnistNovember 3, 2020 at 7:00 a.m. CSTSomethinxe2x80x99s happening in Texas. Before todayxe2x80x99s election, 9.7 million Texans had already votedxe2x80x94 108 percen of total ballots cast there in the last presidenial election. In just four years, Texas has catapulted from second-to-lastin voter turnout to a national leader in early voting. This is no coincidence. Now that this once-red state is emerging as a toss-up, residens are turning out in record numbers, believing that their votes will finally have a meaningful effect on the presidenial election. Though this is a tremendous success story, it also underlines one of our Constitutionxe2x80x99s greatest failures: Under the electoral college, some votes mater far more than others.Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) may have said it bestxe2x80x9cCall me old-fashioned, but I think the person who gets the most votes should winxe2x80x9d The electoral college is indeed an undemocratic travesty, and no mater who wins this election, itxe2x80x99s time for us to move toward a national popular vote.Many electoral college advocates cite its ani-democratic nature as a benefit, explaining that the institution serves as a bulwark against the so-calledxe2x80x9ctyrany of the majority.xe2x80x9d In reality, however, the institution enables a tyrany of the minority, allowing political factions to enrench their rule by appealing to a small group of voters. Itxe2x80x99s mathematically possible to win the electoral college with less than 22 percen of the popular vote. Thatxe2x80x99s an extreme case, but the fact remains that, under the electoral college, a voter in Wyoming has nearly four times the power of a voter in California.By creating artificially narrow results, the electoral college makes it 40 times more likely that the results are close enough that the outcome could be swung by unelected judges. No wonder 61 percen of Americans support the electoral collegexe2x80x99s abolition, according to a recen Gallup poll.Likewise, consider the not-so-far-fetched scenario in which todayxe2x80x99s election ends in a 269-269 draw. The decision then goes to the House of Represenatives, where each state delegation casts one vote. In this situation, the state of North Dakota (population: 762,000) has the same influence as Texas (population: 29 million). In theory, delegations represening just 16 percen of the total U.S. population could pick the next presiden",35,,,

But this whole idea of having all of the electors of a state vote for one candidate, no mater how close the race wise within the state itself, just doesnxe2x80x99t make any sense.What about this: there be electors at the national, rather than state level, chosen in proportion to the percenage each candidate got in the popular vote.

What you can do is give each Statxe2x80x99s electoral college poins to each candidate in proportion to the popular vote outcome in each State. So for example if Biden wins 48% of the vote in Ohio then he gets 48% of the poins, etc. I can get on board with thatBut a wholesale elimination of the EC? No way. 66% of the population lives in the Coastal States.

A presiden-elect doesn't have to be certified by electors, nor does the opponen need to concede for the winer to be the presiden-elect. If the couned votes mathematically and conclusively confirm that a candidate won, then he is the presiden-elect regardless of any legal challenges, certifications, or even whether the vote has been finished couning. Biden is not the presiden of the United States. He is, however, the presiden-elect because there is no possible way Trump can win at this poin even if every single outstanding vote was cast for him, and even if he mouns a legal challenge in every single state he lost.

A lot of people have talked about the fact that we seem to be living in two differen realities.We're living in two differen realities because the media live in their bubble and they refuse to allow any information outside of that bubble to penetrate. That's a dangerous thing. It's a really, really dangerous thing, because if we're living in two separate realities, it's going to be very difficult for us to occupy the same counry.And members of the media are saying there is no voter fraud and no voter irregularity, OK, which is crazy. There is voter fraud and there is voter irregularity. Now, you can say, as I have said, that I don't see the full scale evidence that voter fraud and voter irregularity make up the margins of victory for Joe Biden in some of these states. I think that that is an accurate take. But the media aren't saying that the media immediately go to if you even distribute information surrounding voter fraud or voter irregularity, that has to be stopped because they have created an anodyne bubble and they live inside that anytime bubble and no information is allowed to penetrate that bubble.And because it's not just that that bubble exists for them, it's because they then expand that bubble outward to encompass everybody who simply wans information. This rigs elections, OK? This rigs how people think about politics. It separates the American public and the American public mind ino too. It creates a schizophrenic American public. And that's where we are right now. We're going to get ino all the ways that the media are really the factor behind the quote unquote, rigging of the 2020 election. . . .The social media pros decided they did not wan dissemination of information they didn't like. The most obvious example of this was, of course, the enire Huner Biden story. You'll recall that The New York Post reported that Huner Biden had a laptop and that laptop had text and messages that made one suspicious that perhaps Joe Biden knew more than he was telling about Huner Biden's corrupt business associations abroad and using the Biden family name. And this was just crushed from top down by Twiter.It was crushed from top down by Facebook. Facebook anounced before there was even a fact check that they were going to crush the dissemination of the information. And then the tech pros just anounced, you know what? It's really not our fault. I mean I mean, sure, we shouldn't have quashed that story, but we don't affect elections. Jack Dorsey testified in fron of Congress, said we don't affect elections. That's not what we do. Does Twiter have the ability to influence elections?Who Really Rigged the ElectionClick to expand...An apt description of what we are seeing here.",37,Male,,Other

I am indeed one of ""those people"" who see more to the Left but not for reasons you may think.I see a needed push further left as a response to us having been dragged peristaltically to the right for the last forty years, even under successive Democratic administrations. All through both Reagan terms, and all through Bush and then Clinon, Republicans relenlessly pushed a script that never changed, Democrats are marxists, communists, socialist, we are gutless, we hate our counry, we might not even be fully human. All of our problems are atributable to things Democrats did. Conservatism and ONLY conservatism can save this counry from certain doom and disaster.There isn't a day goes by when I don't sense that this drumbeat is at 180db sound levels now, it is as toxic as RTLM radio in Rwanda during the runup to their genocide.So, for me, a push back to the left somewhat would really only manage to put us back in the cener after all is said and done.In four years Trump has actually erased and reversed so much of the social conract and the former New Deal inspired economics that we're almost at the 1930's right now, minus the stuning Art Deco styles.Anything on, around or in the Democratic Party is being referred to VERBATIM as Radical Leftist Thugs! right now by Trump.Let me repeat thatAnything on, around or in the Democratic Party is being referred to VERBATIM as Radical Leftist Thugs! right now by Trump.It is, watch his last five or six rallies or his other speeches.It's not my opinion, it's a fact, he is actually calling Joe Biden and Kamala Harris radical leftist thugs.And since cockroaches are the thugs of the insect world (see Rwandan Hutu use of ""cockroaches"" to describe Tutsi peoplehere really isn't all that much breathing room between radical leftist thugs and cockroaches, is there?",40,Male,Los Angeles,

Rogue Valley,"Trump said he would release his tax returns when the'auditors finish.' He's been saying this since 2016.10/23/20Presiden Donald Trump once again did not commit to a specific date before the election to release his tax returns, saying they are still ""under audit."" At the presidenial debate on Thursday night, former Vice Presiden Joe Biden pressed Trump to release his tax returns. Trump did not commit to releasing them and instead responded: ""First of all, I called my accounans under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can."" Moderator Kristen Welker gave him another chance to say when he would release his tax returns and she specifically asked for a deadline. He once again wouldn't commit to a specific date. ""As soon as the auditors finish,"" Trump said.During the 2016 election, Trump became the first major presidenial nominee in 40 years to refuse to disclose his tax returns. A New York Times investigation published last monh found Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017. Although he has said he's paid ""millions of dollars in taxes,"" the presiden has never released documenation to show it, breaking a norm that dates back to the 1970s. Biden released his 2019 tax returns ahead of the first presidenial debate, which showed he and his wife paid nearly $300,000 in federal income taxes last year.Click to expand...LOL.

The pollsters did an even worse job than they did in 2016, which suggests they are now no more useful than enrail readers and other charlatan prognosticators. If so, has your basic premise, to compile polls so as to tamp down the noise in any given one, now merely an echo chamber of what has become nothing but noise? R.E.M., Brooklyn, NYA: This question, in various forms, was the question of the week. We must have goten 100 varians.Undoubtedly, this is an issue that many outletxe2x80x94including usxe2x80x94will explore in upcoming weeks and monhs. That said, we would urge caution before reaching any firm conclusions (and before potenially throwing out the baby with the bathwater). Take a look at our map from Election Day. If curren trends hold, then we will have correctly called 49 of the 51 states  (including D.C.) we had a call for. Ohio was a toss-up on our map (though our writen verbiage that day gave it to Trump, so you might argue we had that one right, too, for a total of 49 out of 51). We had North Carolina as barely Dem, and it looks like it's going to end up barely GOP. And we were way off on Florida. Still, the polls (and our method) did considerably beter than if we had used chicken enrails or a Magic 8 Ball or tea leaves or a Ouija Board.There were some very clear failures. The aforemenioned Florida, where it looks like Cuban-American turnout was way underestimated. A lot of the Senate polls were off, particularly in Maine and South Carolina. Some polling houses had a very bad day. Among the Democrat-favoring houses, Quinipiac did particularly poorly. Among the Republican-favoring houses, Rasmussen, Trafalgar, and Pulse all showed they don't actually have some secret sauce that allows them to project the Midwest beter than anyone else.That said, there were some clear successes. As noted above, in the aggregate, the polls actually appear to have goten most of the states right. Most of the national polls were correct, within the margin of error. Some polling houses did quite well, most obviously Selzer & Co. in Iowa. And let us not forget that this election was about as sui generis as it gets, given how unusual Donald Trump is, given the pandemic, and given the unprecedened turnout and use of mail-in ballots.Once all the numbers are in, and once there is time to crunch them, some clear ideas about missteps will emerge. Similarly, we might learn things that exculpate the pollsters even more (like, say, that hundreds of thousands of ballots were ""lost"" by the USPS or rejected due to nudity). We don't particularly wan to guess right now, but if you absolutely insisted, we might speculate that one lesson is that pollsters will need to become ""specialists"" in their state or regions, like Selzer, and that knowing how to do a good national poll, or a good poll of Michigan does not equate to knowing how to do a good poll of Florida.Also, the 2018 polls were quite good.

Then he began casting aspersions on other statesxe2x80x99 vote couns.www.nytimes.com11/4/20WASHINGTONxe2x80x94 With Florida looking red early on Tuesday night, Presiden Trump and his advisers thought they were witessing a repeat of election night 2016, when a victory in Florida foreshadowed a victory over all. That mirage of victory was pierced when Fox News called Arizona for former Vice Presiden Joseph R. Biden Jr. at 11:20 p.m., with just 73 percen of the statxe2x80x99s vote couned. Mr. Trump and his advisers erupted at the news. If it was true that Arizona was lost, it would call ino doubt on any claim of victory the presiden might be able to make.  What ensued for Mr. Trump was a night of angry calls to Republican governors and advice from campaign aides that he ignored, leading to a middle-of-the-night presidenial briefing in which he made a reckless and unsubstaniated string of remarks about the democratic process. Standing in the East Room at 2:30 a.m., he dismissed the election as axe2x80x9cfraudxe2x80x9d and claimed he waned to stop the couning of votes and leave the results to the Supreme Court.  The Trump campaign knew Arizona could be up for grabs, but the Fox News call puting it in Mr. Bidenxe2x80x99s column was symbolic, making it the first state that appeared to have flipped from the presidenxe2x80x99s 2016 batch of wining states. Gov. Doug Ducey, Republican of Arizona, had been on the phone all night with administration officials and campaign staff members, adaman that there were still Republican votes to be couned in his state.Jason Miller, Mr. Trumpxe2x80x99s political adviser, disputed the accuracy of the call on Twiter and franically called Fox News, asking the network to retract it. He was unsuccessful. Several hours later, The Associated Press also called Arizona for Mr. Biden.  Keeping Arizona in play was critical to the narrow path the campaign still saw to a victory on Wednesday, along with Georgia and Pensylvania. As the map closed in on the Trump campaign on Wednesday, with Michigan and Wisconsin being called for Mr. Biden, the presiden was not seen in public all day. For all of the presidenxe2x80x99s superstitions, and his atempts to surround himself with the team that helped lead him to victory four years ago, he found himself in a far weaker position this time. But by Wednesday, several White House officials and outside advisers said they were hopeful, but not particularly optimistic, that Mr. Trumpxe2x80x99s legal challenges in several states would be able to change the trajectory of the race. The presiden himself tweeted a suggestion thatxe2x80x9ca large number of secretly dumped ballotxe2x80x9d had cost him Michigan, a message Twiter quickly labeled misleading.Click to expand...Apparenly, Fox calling Arizona for Joe Biden on Tuesday night freaked out Trump which led to his flurry of tweets about stopping the coun, lawsuits, etc.They even called Fox and Rupert Murdoch to demand a retraction lol.",48,Male,,Independen

George50,"While senior Trump administration officials said this week that Iran has been actively inerfering in the presidenial election, many inelligence officials said they remained far more concerned about Russia, which in recen days has hacked ino state and local computer networks in breaches that could allow Moscow broader access to American voting infrastructure.The discovery of the hacks came as American inelligence agencies, infiltrating Russian networks themselves, have pieced together details of what they believe are Russiaxe2x80x99s plans to inerfere in the presidenial race in its final days or immediately after the election on Nov. 3. Officials did not make clear what Russia planed to do, but they said its operations would be inended to help Presiden Trump, potenially by exacerbating disputes around the results, especially if the race is too close to call.There is no evidence that the Russians have changed any vote tallies or voter registration information, officials said. They added that the Russian-backed hackers had penetrated the computer networks without taking further action, as they did in 2016. But American officials expect that if the presidenial race is not called on election night, Russian groups could use their knowledge of the local computer systems to deface websites, release nonpublic information or take similar steps that could sow chaos and doubts about the inegrity of the results, according to American officials briefed on the inelligence.Some U.S. inelligence officials view Russiaxe2x80x99s inenions as more significan than the anouncemen Wednesday night by the director of national inelligence, John Ratcliffe, that Iran has been involved in the spreading of faked, threatening emails, which were made to appear as if they came from the Proud Boys, a right-wing extremist group.A hacking group believed to be operating at the behest of Russiaxe2x80x99s Federal Security Service, the F.S.B.xe2x80x94 the successor agency to the Soviet-era K.G.B.xe2x80x94 has infiltrated multiple state and local computer networks in recen weeks, according to officials and researchers. The group, known to private researchers as Energetic Bear or Dragonfly, has hacked ino American nuclear, water and power plans and airports before. While it has stopped short of shuting them down, the group is considered to be among Russiaxe2x80x99s most formidable.The Russian hackers were able to get inside some election administratorsxe2x80x99 systems and had access to voting information. What alarmed officials was the targets, the timinxe2x80x94 the atacks began two monhs agoxe2x80x94 and the adversary, which is known for burrowing inside the supply chain of critical infrastructure that Russia may wan to take down in the future. The officials fear that Russia could change, delete or freeze voter data, making it harder for voters to cast ballots, invalidating mail-in ballots or creating enough uncertainy to undermine election results.xe2x80x9cItxe2x80x99s reasonable to assume any atempt at the election systems could be for the same purpose,xe2x80x9d said John Hultquist, the director of threat analysis at FireEye, a security firm that has been tracking the Russian groupxe2x80x99s foray ino state and local systems.xe2x80x9cThis could be the reconaissance for disruptive activity.xe2x80x9dThe threat of Iranian inerference, officials said, was real and troubling. But other curren and former officials said there was litle doubt that Russia remained a greater threat and questioned why the focus was on Iran on Wednesday nighthtps://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/...rence-hacks.html?referringSource=articleShareHopefully these concerns will not come to pass.

It has absolutely no influence nationally.  States are free to determine any means they desire to choose their Electors, and they can change their minds anytime they please.  Presidens are always determined by the States, never the people.Even in the very first election in 1788, only six of the eleven voting States held popular votes in their State.  Five States did not.

Rogue Valley,"Post-debate CNN poll: Biden wins final presidenial debat10/23/20Overall, 53% of voters who watched the debate said that Biden won the matchup, while 39% said that Presiden Donald Trump did.  Viewers once again said that Biden's criticisms of Trump were largely fair (73% said they were fair, 26% unfair), and they split over whether Trump's atacks on Biden were fair (50% said yes, 49% no). All told, though, the debate did not do much to move impressions of either candidate. Favorable views of Biden before the debate stood at 55%, and they held steady at 56% in post-debate inerviews. Likewise, Trump's numbers held steady, with 42% saying they had a favorable view of the Presiden in inerviews conducted before Thursday's debate and 41% saying the same afterward. More debate watchers, though, said Trump's performance raised concerns about how he would handle the presidency (55%) than did Biden's (41%). Although Thursday's even was far less conenious than the first presidenial debate, Biden was far more apt to be seen as directly answering the moderator's questions (62% said he did, 31% said Trump). Women were more likely than men to say that Biden did the beter job in the debate (60% of women said Biden won, 35% Trump, while among men, 47% said Biden won, 44% said Trump did). Independens also largely felt Biden won (55% Biden to 36% Trump), as did moderates (56% Biden to 37% Trump) and White voters with college degrees (64% Biden to 29% Trump). Among those 65 and older -- a group backing Biden in greater numbers than they did Hillary Clinon in 2016, according to most polls -- the verdict was a split decision, with 46% saying Biden won, 43% Trump and 10% saying they both did equally well. Younger voters broadly saw Biden as the winer, 66%, to 27% for Trump among those under age 45.Click to expand...Watching the debate together in North Carolina was a group of 11 undecided voters. Some had voted for Hillary Clinon in 2016 and some had voted for Donald Trump. But they were all undecided for the 2020 election going ino this final debate. One individual said that he would vote for Joe Biden as long as Amy Coney Barret was confirmed. When all was said and done, none of the 11 said they would vote for Donald Trump after this debate. 7 of the 11 said they had now decided to vote for Joe Biden. 4 voters were still undecided.If this ratio is emblematic of all undecided voters remaining that haven't yet voted (~10%), then the prospects look bleak indeed for Donald Trump.Trump fails to get the game-changing momen he waned in final debate with Joe BidenPresiden Donald Trump heeded the pleas of his advisers when he took the debate stage Thursday night, delivering a much more restrained performance as he took on his rival, Joe Biden, but he failed to get the game-changing momen he needed to dramatically alter the trajectory of the race.www.cn.com",55,Male,,Independen

Glitch,"Razoo saidThe Electoral College was created by delegates in 1787 as a compromise between electing the presiden by a vote in Congress, or electing through a popular vote by qualified citizens. The Founders set up the Electoral College for a few reasons: To balance the inerests of high-population and low-population statesFive times in history, presidenial candidates have won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College. This has led some to question why Americans use this system to elect their presidens in the first place.What Is the Electoral College?The system calls for the creation, every four years, of a temporary group of electors equal to the total number of represenatives in Congress. Technically, it is these electors, and not the American people, who vote for the presiden. In modern elections, the first candidate to get 270 of the 538 total electoral votes wins the White House.For starters, there were no political parties in 1787. The drafters of the Constitution assumed that electors would vote according to their individual discretion, not the dictates of a state or national party. Today, most electors are bound to vote for their partxe2x80x99s candidate.And even more importan, the Constitution says nothing about how the states should allot their electoral votes. The assumption was that each electorxe2x80x99s vote would be couned.But over time, all but two states (Maine and Nebraska) passed laws to give all of their electoral votes to the candidate who wins the statxe2x80x99s popular vote coun. Any semblance of elector independence has been fully wiped outThe Founders also assumed that most elections would ultimately be decided by neither the people nor the electors, but by the House of Represenatives.According to the Constitution, if no single candidate wins a majority of the electoral votes, the decision goes to the House, where each state gets one vote.Why Was the Electoral College Created?The Founding Fathers had to compromise when it came to devising a system to elect the presidenwww.history.comClick to expand...I don't know where you are geting your information, but it is riddled with errors.First, there were only four times when a Presiden won the Electoral College vote and lost to a national total of the popular vote (which really isn't a thing) in 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016.  During the election of 1824 the candidate that won the most Electoral College votes also won the most popular votes, but did not become Presiden.  John Q. Adams, who became Presiden, lost both the popular vote and the Electoral College vote.Second, there were most certainly political parties in 1787.  The two most dominate political parties were the Federalists and the Ani-Federalists.  The Federalists existed from the mid-1780s unil 1828, when it was replaced by the Democratic Party.  The Ani-Federalists existed from the mid-1780s unil 1800, when I was replaced by the Democratic-Republican Party.Third, six of the eleven States that voted in the very first election in 1788 used a state-wide popular vote to determine how their Electors would be selected.  In the remaining five States the State legislators determined the Electors for the Electoral College without a popular vote.  It didn't happen ""over time,"" it happened during the very first election and in every election since.Fourth, the founders waned the States to determine both the Senate and the Presiden, not the people.  The people had the House of Represenatives, the States were responsible for everything else at the federal level.  At least unil the Seveneenh Amendmen was ratified.  The only time the House would be responsible for determining the Presiden is when all the candidates fail to achieve 50% + 1 Electoral College votes.

We know that now.By the way, that Voting Rights Act that SCOTUS destroyed?That's coming back one way or another, and when it does, it will not be something courts can weigh in on anymore.The inegrity of elections should never have been allowed to be politicized in such a treasonous way.",61,Male,Los Angeles,

If your insurance company isnxe2x80x99t doing right by you, you should have another, beter choice. Whether youxe2x80x99re covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, Biden will give you the choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare. As in Medicare, the Biden public option will reduce costs for patiens by negotiating lower prices from hospitals and other health care providers. It also will beter coordinate among all of a patienxe2x80x99s doctors to improve the efficacy and quality of their care, and cover primary care without any co-paymens. And it will bring relief to small businesses struggling to afford coverage for their employees.Increasing the value of tax credits to lower premiums and extend coverage to more working Americans. Today, families that make between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level may receive a tax credit to reduce how much they have to pay for health insurance on the individual marketplace. The dollar amoun of the financial assistance is calculated to ensure each family does not have to pay more than a certain percenage of their income on a silver (medium generosity) plan. But, these shares of income are too high and silver planxe2x80x99 deductibles are too high. Additionally, many families making more than 400% of the federal poverty level (about $50,000 for a single person and $100,000 for a family of four), and thus not qualifying for financial assistance, still struggle to afford health insurance. As Presiden, Biden will help middle class families by eliminating the 400% income cap on tax credit eligibility and lowering the limit on the cost of coverage from 9.86% of income to 8.5%. This means that no family buying insurance on the individual marketplace, regardless of income, will have to spend more than 8.5% of their income on health insurance. Additionally, Biden will increase the size of tax credits by calculating them based on the cost of a more generous gold plan, rather than a silver plan. This will give more families the ability to afford more generous coverage, with lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.Expanding coverage to low-income Americans. Access to affordable health insurance shouldnxe2x80x99t depend on your statxe2x80x99s politics. But today, state politics is geting in the way of coverage for millions of low-income Americans. Governors and state legislatures in 14 states have refused to take up the Affordable Care Actxe2x80x99s expansion of Medicaid eligibility, denying access to Medicaid for an estimated 4.9 million adults. Bidenxe2x80x99s plan will ensure these individuals get covered by offering premium-free access to the public option for those 4.9 million individuals who would be eligible for Medicaid but for their statxe2x80x99s inaction, and making sure their public option covers the full scope of Medicaid benefits. States that have already expanded Medicaid will have the choice of moving the expansion population to the premium-free public option as long as the states coninue to pay their curren share of the cost of covering those individuals. Additionally, Biden will ensure people making below 138% of the federal poverty level get covered. Hexe2x80x99ll do this by automatically enrolling these individuals when they ineract with certain institutions (such as public schools) or other programs for low-income populations (such as SNAP).",70,Male,,Liberal

Rogue Valley,"Trump plans to fire heads of FBI, CIA and Penagon if he wins re-electionThe list of planed replacemens is much longer, but these are Trump's priorities.www.axios.com10/25/20If Presiden Trump wins re-election, he'll move to immediately fire FBI Director Christopher Wray and also expects to replace CIA Director Gina Haspel and Defense Secretary Mark Esper. The list of planed replacemens is much longer, but these are Trump's priorities, starting with Wray. Wray and Haspel are despised and distrusted almost universally in Trump's iner circle. He would have fired both already, one official said, if not for the political headaches of acting before Nov. 3.  A win, no mater the margin, will embolden Trump to ax anyone he sees as constraining him from enacting desired policies or going after perceived enemies.  Trump last week signed an executive order that set off alarm bells as a means to politicize the civil service. An administration official said the order ""is a really big deal"" that would make it easier for presidens to get rid of career governmen officials. There could be shake-ups across other departmens. The presiden has never been impressed with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, for example. But that doesn't carry the urgency of replacing Wray or Haspel. The nature of top inelligence and law enforcemen posts has traditionally carried an expectation for a higher degree of independence and separation from politics.While Trump has also privately vened about Atorney General Bill Barr, he hasn't made any formal plans to replace him, an official said. Trump is furious that Barr isn't releasing before the election what Trump hoped would be a bombshell report by U.S. Atorney John Durham on the Obama administration's handling of the Trump-Russia investigation. Durham's investigation has yet to produce any high-profile indictmens of Obama-era officials as Trump had hoped. ""The view of Haspel in the West Wing is that she still sees her job as manipulating people and outcomes, the way she must have when she was working assets in the field,"" one source with direct knowledge of the inernal conversations told Axios. ""It's bred a lot of suspicion of her motives."" Trump is also increasingly frustrated with Haspel for opposing the declassification of documens that would help the Justice Departmen's Durham report. Trump is angry his second FBI chief didn't launch a formal investigation ino Huner Biden's foreign business conectionxe2x80x94 and didn't purge more officials Trump believes abused power to investigate his 2016 campaign's ties to Russia.

The presiden needed to max out his performance with rural voters, halt his erosion in the suburbs, and turn out white working-class voters who didnxe2x80x99t vote in 2016. Biden needed a big turnout in the big cities -- particularly among African-American votersxe2x80x94 increase his share among Latino voters and recapture some of the places that flipped to Trump after twice voting for Presiden Barack Obama.While itxe2x80x99s too early to tell how successful each has been at meeting those goals, one thing seems clear from our most recen reportinxe2x80x94 Trump has failed to turn his fortunes around in the suburbs, particularly among womenxe2x80x9cHonestly, all the moms I know, we are really nervous about our kids, what kind of future theyxe2x80x99re going to have. And Trump is the one making us nervous,xe2x80x9d a woman in suburban Livingston Couny told Tim Alberta. Swing state Republicans arenxe2x80x99t enirely convinced that Trumpxe2x80x99s situation is dire. While acknowledging the obstacles to his reelection, they are quick to poin out a salien fact: Trump also trailed in polls in many batleground states at this poin in 2016 only to win them narrowly on Election Day.

Rogue Valley,"The FBI is investigating whether purported Huner Biden-Burisma emails were part of a foreign inelligence operation10/15/20The FBI is investigating whether alleged emails of communications between Huner Biden and a senior executive at the Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma Holdings were part of a foreign inelligence operation, NBC News reported. The emails first surfaced in a dubious and widely discredited story from the New York Post this week purporting to feature ""smoking-gun"" emails showing the Burisma executive discussing with Huner the prospect of meeting his father, Joe Biden, when Biden was vice presiden in 2015. Though the article offered litle new information and conained a multitude of falsehoods, Trumpworld seized on it as inconrovertible proof that Ukrainian officials took advanage of Huner Biden's position at Burisma to extract special treatmen from Joe Biden during the Obama administration. There is no evidence that these theories hold merit. But they've been amplified by Trump's allies in Congress and conservative media, as well as by Russian governmen officials and state-run media outlets. News of the FBI investigation ino the Huner Biden emails came shortly after it was reported that US officials warned the White House last year that Russian operatives were using Giuliani to funel disinformation to Trump.According to the New York Post story, the emails came from a water-damaged laptop and external hard drive that an unidenified person dropped off at a repair shop in Wilmington, Delaware, in April 2019. The shop's owner, who Business Insider idenified as a man named John Paul Mac Isaac, is an avid Trump supporter and told The Washington Post that he is legally blind. Despite that, Mac Isaac said, he was almost sure the person who dropped off the laptop was Huner Biden. But the laptop was never picked up, he said.  On Sunday, October 11, the New York Post said that Giuliani gave the paper a copy of the hard drive. The story was published three days later, on October 14. After the story dropped, several reporters tracked down Mac Isaac, who could not get his facts straight about the timeline of evens laid out in the Post's story for which he was the source. The Daily Beast reported that ""throughout the inerview, Mac Isaac switched back and forth from saying he reached out to law enforcemen after viewing the files in the laptop to saying that it was actually the Federal Bureau of Investigation that conacted him."" ""At one poin, Mac Isaac claimed that he was emailing someone from the FBI about the laptop,"" The Daily Beast said.Click to expand...This ""story"" is so conrived as to be laughable.

So Biden being presiden for a couple years of it, is barely a blip. I was just hoping for the best. The democrat party, on the other hand, politics IS their religion. They don't just disagree with us. They HATE us. Where as we believe they are politically wrong, and enitled to their opinion, they believe we are evil. So they demonize the Republican candidate, define them as racist, bigoted, homophobic, xenophobic and any other ""ism or phobe"" they can think of, which in their mind, makes it ok to atack and remove by any means necessary. They'll make up stories, lie to the FISA court, and falsify documens to do it, as they did with the Mueller ""investigation"".

jnug,"The result of this year's elections outside of the Presidenial can be summarized in one senence: The GOP successfully demonized the DEM party as a party of wild eyed socialists.Its that simple. Media has become instananeous which also makes the loudest most striden voices, those that lie at the ends of the spectrum virtually the only voices that break through on a regular basis. While the GOP is not a monolith and I do not mean to imply that it is, it is a cenralized organization. The DEM party does feature a bigger ten but it is a scatershot operation. It was not even a cenralized organization during the 2016 push to get Hillary to the promised land. It literally just handed the whole magila to the Clinon campaign team lock stock and barrel which is not cenralizing an organization. That is shirking responsibility. The DNC was flat broke at the time which did not help maters any.The difference between the two party organizations is substanial in the political sense. While ad's, political terms or art, phraseology, particular stands are put through the filter of the Party in the case of the GOP, that simply does not happen in the DEM Party.Why do you think the Lincoln Project has been lauded for producing the best ads supporting the Biden Candidacy. Do you think that is some acciden? Since the DEM Party is not cenralized it also has difficulty moving people up through an organization and they don't really learn to act like an organization and that level of political inefficiency is hard to overcome. Political operatives with real talen are not fed up through the DEM Party.Here is an excellen example: ""DEFUND THE POLICE"". Whoever came up with that Lulu should be shot at sunrise. That hot mess did not even describe what proponens waned to do. The term ""Defund the Police"" required explanation as soon as it was coined. In politics if you are explaining you are losing. Worse, people ran with it before even understanding that it did not even mean what proponens waned to do. The toothpaste was out of the tube and good luck geting it back inHere is another good example: ""OPEN BORDERS"". What the hell does that even mean? If you say that to me, I will take it literally. In the 21st Cenury ""open borders"" simply will not work. By the same token considering the societal and economic traditions that exist on our southern border that have existed for more than two cenuries clearly some nuanced solution needs to be developed.On the other hand, the GOP develops easy to understand themes from its more cenralized organization and simply does not even bother to explain them. Now since the devil is in the details that generally means we have been ben over the desk and violated before we know what has hit us. Examples- cut the deficit- deregulat- cut taxes (often presened as some sort of middle class tax cut when in fact its the fat cats and the corporations that get the bulk of the break- trickle down- BUILD THAT WALL. The only fly in that oinmen was MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT. Heck, the GOP itself did not even believe in that one, politically supporting it while legislatively rejecting itThe poin I am making is not just that the scatershot DEM's often shoot themselves in the foot because they are a scatershot organization. The other poin I am trying to make is that when the GOP tells you something that sounds like another ben over the desk and be violated even, believe it. Don't try to put a friendly face on it. Don't try to look for some silver lining. That does not mean you should not try to negotiate out the worst aspects of some GOP agenda or proposed legislation. By all means do because that is the job.That said, is there a more obvious shirking of responsibility than the GOP not even developing a 2020 platform? Then again,""Whatever Donald wans"" is once again a prety easy message to deliver and understand and nobody in the GOP was trying to explain it now were they.",77,,,

Rogue Valley,"EU, UK Slap Sanctions on Russian Spies for Hacking German Parliamen - The Moscow TimesThe 2015 cyber atack completely paralyzed the IT infrastructure of the Bundestag.www.themoscowtimes.com10/22/20The EU and Britain imposed sanctions Thursday on senior Russian inelligence officers for their alleged role in hacking the computer network in the German parliamen in 2015. The head of the GRU military inelligence agency, Igor Kostyukov, and inelligence officer Dmitri Badin have been baned from EU soil and are subject to an asset freeze. A GRU unit, alleged to be responsible for cyber atacks, has also been added to the EU sanctions list. Britain, which formally left the EU in January, said it was joining the bloc in enforcing asset freezes and travel bans against the two officers and inelligence unit. A cyber atack in April and May 2015 completely paralyzed the IT infrastructure of the Bundestag and the enire parliamen had to be taken offline for days while it was fixed. In a statemen, the European Council said that ""a considerable amoun of data had been stolen"" and that ""the email accouns of several members of parliamen, including that of Chancellor Angela Merkel"" had been hit. Merkel has publicly blamed Russia for the hacking. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with Germany and our European parters to hold Russia to accoun for cyber atacks designed to undermine Western democracies. ""This criminal behavior brings the Russian Governmen ino further disrepute,"" he added.Kostyukov was already on another EU sanctions list.

From wikipedia Bookmakers thought Leicester's victory was so unlikely that Ladbrokes and William Hill offered odds of 5,000xe2x80x931 for it at the start of the season. Neither bookmaker had ever paid out such long odds, and the trophy resulted in the largest payout in British sporting history with total winings ofxc2xa325 million.

Things that no one saw coming, things that could not be predicted.  Things that create a momen in history that is significan because it is so rare for something that unlikely to occur.  But after shocking the world, reality sets in.  The US didn't come back and win gold again in 84.  Leicester didn't shock the world again.  No, they pulled off the impossible, came back and tried and people stopped underestimating them and they got their asses kicked.  Polls didn't predict a Trump win in 2016, but Trump was within most state polling margin of errors at the end and barely won.  By election date I think they had Trump around 35-38% chance to win.  Trump did overcome these numbers before, but the difference between 2016 and today is that Americans have seen what a Trump America looks like, they don't like it.  Americans sat home in 2016 thinking there is no way Trump wins.  They know that isn't true this time around.  Trump isn't runing against Clinon this time around.

As we have seen when Trump created vacuum in this space, it became a wild west where States were competing with each other driving up prices for venilators, PPE and other resources in a panic (AND competing against Feds too!) Some states had to reach out to other counries on their own. Some were making 4-million dollar deals in McDonald's parking lots. That is NOT normal or effective or rightJust like we have a national defense against military atacks, it makes sense to have a national defense against a global pandemic.States also do not have resources for each one developing their own tests, protocols, studies on what works and what does not, treatmens, etc. That's something Feds can and should be responsible for. That's what CDC is for.Next, our States do not have enforceable borders. Think about shutdowns where people are free to ener and leave neighboring states - that's one of the reasons our shutdowns were not as effective as they were in Europe.

Rogue Valley,"Joe Biden is crushing Donald Trump on TV10/22/20Things were supposed to be differen for Donald Trump this time around. Unlike in 2016, when he ran a deeply underfunded campaign against Hillary Clinon, his 2020 reelection race would be a Rolls-Royce effort. Trump opened his 2020 fundraising commitee on the day he was inaugurated as the 45th Presiden and, in total, through a variety of enities has already spen more than $1 billion on his bid for a second term, according to The Associated Press. And yet, even with all of that money, Trump is being dominated by former Vice Presiden Joe Biden in ad spending in the vast majority of swing states. Calculations made by CNN's David Wright reveal that Biden's campaign has spen far more than Trump's on ads in Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Pensylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Colorado and New Hampshire. And in some of those places it's not even close. Biden has spen $98 million to Trump's $69 million on ads in Florida. In Pensylvania, it's a whopping $33 million gap; $61 million for Biden to $28 million for Trump. Trump's campaign has outspen Biden's in only four competitive states: Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and Texas.At the start of the 2020 campaign, few politicos -- of either party -- would have predicted that Trump would be in any serious trouble in any of that quartet of states, all of which he won by 5 poins or more in 2016. And yet, polling in all four states now suggests Biden and Trump are runing neck and neck. Now. Money -- whether spen on TV ads or anything else -- isn't determinative in a presidenial election. If it were, Hillary Clinon would be presiden right now. But spending on TV does indicate where each of the campaigns believes its biggest opportunities -- and vulnerabilities -- lie. And that Trump is not only being drowned out by Biden in the vast majority of swing states but also being forced to spend heavily in places like Texas and Georgia tells you everything you need to know about the curren state of this campaignClick to expand...Trump spen millions in campaign cash on hosting parties for loyalists at Mar-a-Lago and for private jets for his adult children.

That's more than six times the number of votes cast by the same poin in 2016. Polling data have indicated for monhs that Democrats have inended to vote earlier at much higher rates than Republicans, who were reacting to Presiden Trump's near-constan false claims that voting by mail would lead to widespread fraud.Democrats have cast about 53% of the early votes, according to predictive analysis by the data firm TargetSmart, which uses voter data beyond party registration to project turnout trends. That's compared with 36% by Republicans.  Notably, African American voters make up a larger share of early voters than in 2016. More than six times as many African American voters have voted early this year than had at the same poin in the last presidenial election, according to TargetSmart. In Georgia, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said the registration database used to check people in for early voting was bogged down by the high amoun of traffic.Click to expand...Despite Republican efforts to suppress the vote, Americans are voting in record numbers.  By the last Biden/Trump debate this coming Thursday, 50 million Americans will already have voted.It is estimated that 150 million Americans will vote in the 2020 elections, easily seting a new US voting record.",91,Male,,Independen

osca1,"MTAtech saidCNN: That Gallup poll doesn't say what Donald Trump (or tosca1) thinks it doesBut here's the thing that both Trump and his campaign seem to miss: It is an incredibly damning indictmen of Trump personally that, in a counry where a majority of the people believe they are beter off than they were four years ago, the incumben Presiden is currenly losing badly in his bid for a second term.What the Gallup numbers suggest is that even though people feel beter off than they were at this time in 2016 -- a somewhat remarkable finding given the ongoing coronavirus pandemic -- they don't ascribe that beter feeling to Trump and his policies. Or even if they do give Trump credit for feeling ""beter off"" -- usually a measure of economic stability, optimism and well-being -- there are other things they prioritize when it comes to choosing the next presiden(Importan note: The Gallup poll was conducted before the first presidenial debate -- and Trump's erratic performance. It was also in the field prior to Trump's diagnosis last week with Covid-19.Consider Gallup's other findings as they relate to Trump. His job approval for the monh of September in Gallup polling is 44%. (That compares to 49% for Barack Obama in September 2012, 53% for George w. Bush in September 2004 and 60% for Bill Clinon in September 1996.)

We still have around 7% undecided, but not enough for Trump to overcome Biden's lead. Back in 2016 at this time or poin in the campaign, there were 16% undecided. A fairly large pool for Trump to pull from to overcome what was at that time a four poin Hillary lead. With Biden ahead by 10, with the small pool of 7% to overcome that, I can't see Trump pulling this outThe only question left in my mind, will Biden have coat tails enough to pull the senate ino democratic conrol.

Slavister,"Perotista saidTrump hasn't added any new supporters since he became presiden. 46% that he received in 2016 is in my opinion, the highest he can expect in 2020. Biden on the other hand is much less disliked by swing voters, you can call them independens than Hillary Clinon was. Trump won these swing voters, independens in 2016 46-42 with 12% voting against both major party candidates. Their disdain for both was that high that they gladly voted for a candidate they knew had no chance of wining.I would estimate looking at all the recen polls that Biden has picked up at least half of that 12%. They still don't like Trump, but being they disliked Biden a lot less than Clinon, they moved ino Biden's corner. The result is Biden being between 49-51% in the polls since May while Trump is stuck down at between 41-43%. Rarely has either on risen above or fallen below those percenages. It seems most folks have made up their minds who they'll vote for as far back as May and it seems there is no changing their minds.

Rogue Valley,"'He shot himself in the foot': Seniors repelled by Trumpxe2x80x99s pandemic response10/23/20Marcelo Monesinos voted for Presiden Donald Trump in 2016 because he said he saw ""a man who would bring a lot of change."" Four years later, after losing a family member to the coronavirus, Monesinos, 72, is one of many seniors who now say they can no longer support the presiden because of his handling of the pandemic. ""He knew everything all the way back in February and he didn't take the precautions ... he didn't believe in science. He doesn't believe in doctors,"" Monesinos said. ""He always tries to blame somebody else, like a litle kid."" Trump is atempting a repeat of his first stuning victory by banding together a base that's still mostly white, largely male, less educated and older. Underpining Trump's success in 2016 was, in part, an army of seniors that made up a large slice of the electorate and backed him by 7 percenage poins over Hillary Clinon, according to national exit poll data. Older voters are among the most likely to vote and have sided with Republican nominees in every presidenial election since 2004, reinforcing Trump four years ago and helping tilt key batleground states in his favor.  But this cycle, former Vice Presiden Joe Biden is cuting ino Trump's coalition, making significan gains with older voters across the U.S., particularly in must-win states for Trump. A recen ABC News/Washington Post poll found the two men runing even among likely voters 65 and older nationally -- 48% to 49%.In follow-up inerviews with more than a dozen independen and Republican voters over 65 who participated in recen ABC News/Washington Post polls in Florida and North Carolina, including some who voted for Trump in 2016, most said they're repelled by the presiden after four years.

Approval does not equal voter turnout.  Voter turnout was deeply depressed in 2016, and it is wildly excited now.  What this means is that approval will have a much greater correlation to turnout this year.2. The impact of an investigation ino Clinon and the resulting crash in her approval can't be overstated.  These factors don't exist for BidenSo I've included two maps.  The first is Clinon's lead on October 7, the second is the map after the Comey leter and on election day.

Democrats have accused Telizhenko of inenionally spreading Russian disinformation. In mid-September, the US Treasury Departmen sanctioned another ally of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani -- conroversial Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach -- and accused him of being an ""active Russian agen"" who is part of Moscow's inerference in the 2020 campaignA source familiar told CNN that Ukrainians became aware of the visa revocation when Telizhenko atempted to board a flight from Kiev to New York and was unable to do so. It is unclear why he was planing to visit New York, the source said, but they believed it was tied to the US presidenial election being just around the corner. Speaking about Telizhenko's visa revocation, Ukrainian ambassador to the US Volodymyr Yelchenko told CNN, ""The guy fully deserved it."" A State Departmen spokesperson declined to commen, telling CNN, ""Visa records are confidenial under U.S. law; therefore, we canot discuss the details of individual visa cases.Click to expand...Andriy Telizhenko and Andrei Derkach, who have been working with Rudy Giuliani, the Trump campaign, Rep.

The Proud Boys have become emblematic of the new-style hate groups. Founded in 2016, the group embraces the full range of prejudices from xenophobia to racism and misogyny. However, it cloaks its bigotry in a language that celebrates western heritage and traditional values. Rather than condemn feminism, it calls forxe2x80x9cvenerating the housewife.xe2x80x9d The group claims to be aniracist, but rejectxe2x80x9cani-racial guiltxe2x80x9d.

Trumpxe2x80x99s failure to openly condemn White supremacy is disturbing in its own right.

Rogue Valley,"Across the counry, Democratic enhusiasm is propelling an enormous wave of early votin10/15/20With less than three weeks to go before Nov. 3, roughly 15 million Americans have already voted in the fall election, reflecting an extraordinary level of participation despite barriers erected by the coronavirus pandemicxe2x80x94 and seting a trajectory that could result in the majority of voters casting ballots before Election Day for the first time in U.S. history. In Georgia this week, voters waited as long as 11 hours to cast their ballots on the first day of early voting. In North Carolina, nearly 1 in 5 of roughly 500,000 who have returned mail ballots so far did not vote in the last presidenial election. In Michigan, more than 1 million peoplexe2x80x94 roughly one-fourth of total turnout in 2016xe2x80x94 have already voted. The picture is so stark that election officials around the counry are reporting record early turnout, much of it in person, meaning that more results could be available on election night than previously thought. So far, much of the early voting appears to be driven by heightened enhusiasm among Democrats. Of the roughly 3.5 million voters who have cast ballots in six states that provide partisan breakdowns, registered Democrats outumber Republicans by roughly 2 to 1, according to a Washington Post analysis of data in Florida, Iowa, Maine, Kenucky, North Carolina and Pensylvania.  Additionally, those who have voted include disproportionate numbers of Black voters and women, according to state datxe2x80x94 groups that favor former vice presiden Joe Biden over Presiden Trump in recen polls.Dozens of voters who have shown up on their statesxe2x80x99 first day of early voting over the past several weeks have described a desire to cast their ballots at the first possible momen as a statemen against the presidenxe2x80x9cLast night felt like Christmas Eve,xe2x80x9d said Tony Lewis, 39, who showed up at the Kenucky Exposition Cener in Louisville on Tuesday just as polls opened at 8:30 a.m. for the first day of in-person voting.xe2x80x9cI just waned to get out and be one of the first ones to cast my vote to hopefully end the insanity we are living in under the curren administrationxe2x80x9d  Election administrators have been preparing for monhs for a surge in mail voting among Americans trying to avoid coronavirus infection at the polls. And operatives in both parties expected the early vote to favor Biden, in part because Trumpxe2x80x99s repeated atacks on the inegrity of mail voting have resonated more deeply with his own supporters, who are eschewing mail ballots to an exten that has alarmed GOP operatives.

The measures were met with acclaim as a long-awaited response to Russiaxe2x80x99s inervenions in American democracy. In reality, though, these measures are litle more than a pinprickxe2x80x94 the latest episode in a long history of efforts by the Trump administration to appear tough on Russia while actually signaling to the Kremlin that U.S. elections remain open to inerference. The simple fact is that even harsh-looking sanctions have litle impact when therexe2x80x99s zero political will to enforce them.  The Treasury Departmenxe2x80x99s actions imposed asset freezes on Andriy Derkach, a Ukrainian politician and alleged Kremlin agen, and three mid-level bureaucrats at a Russian troll farm.  Derkachxe2x80x99s inclusion was somewhat surprising, as Derkach met with Trumpxe2x80x99s personal atorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, at least three times and has been at the cener of a disinformation campaign perpetuated by Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa). We shouldnxe2x80x99t be fooled. From its start, the Trump administration has systematically undermined U.S. sanctions against Russia. Immediately upon enering the White House, Trump tried to lift Obama-era sanctions and return diplomatic compounds seized by the United States due to inerference in the 2016 electionMonhs later, Congress drew up a bill to strengthen Russia sanctions and preven Trump from lifting them. When it passed with a veto-proof majority, Trump issued a statemen expressing displeasurexe2x80x94 and signaling that enforcemen would be lax.  His administration has done exactly that. It delayed implemening the law and missed key deadlines, grudgingly conceding only after inervenion by congressional leaders. This episode sen an unambiguous message to both Moscow and the private sector: The Trump administration had no stomach for tough sanctions against Russia. Meanwhile, the administration dragged its feet on imposing consequences for the nerve agen atack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. It delayed chemical weapons sanctions required by law, only moving forward after formal requests and demands from bipartisan congressional leaders. Unsurprisingly, when the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was recenly poisoned with a similar agen, the Trump administration saidxe2x80x94 and didxe2x80x94 nothing. Trumpxe2x80x99s policy on Russia sanctions has been an elaborate ruse, designed to project toughness while actually doing litle to follow through.

Anagram,"Mycroft saidThey've been doing it for more than 16 years.  They get it right.  And party affiliation polling is much differen than other polling.Click to expand...Why do you think they get it right? The last three elections they participated in were the 2008 presidenial election, the 2010 congressional ballot, and the 2012 presidenial election. They were either the most inaccurate, or tied for the most inaccurate, pollster in all three among the 15 pollsters in 2008, 7 pollsters in 2010, and 10 pollsters in 2012 that made it to RCP. Those are the only things that Gallup polled that produce tangible numbers. There is no objective standard to check Gallup's numbers against for party affiliation or presidenial job approval or any of the many other things they measure. The only ones you can objectively measure, they were bad at the last time produced them.If you look at the polling in previous years, you would expect to see evidence of pollsters using what you would claim as ""bogus numbers"" for party affiliation geting inaccurate results. Yet in 2016, all the national polls that were supposedly ""wildly oversampling Democrats"" ended up prety close to dead on. There wasn't a single miss from the last week outside a standard deviation. They averaged about a 1% miss.In 2012, Gallup was again the worst performing pollster overall. Dean Chambers made the same claim that you were making about the polls oversampling Democrats. Source. The final result was that every single pollster ended up underestimating Obama's margin (or having Romney actually up, like Gallup).So if this is a constan theme among pollsters, why do we not get pollsters consistenly overestimating Democratic support? Sometimes there's a slight bias in the Democrats favor like 2016, but just as often it's in the Republicans favor like 2012. This despite those same polls ""oversampling"" Democrats compared to Gallup.So I'm honestly asking, why do you think Gallup is the gold standard? I canot find any data showing them to be right more than any other pollster, nor can I find a consisten track record of pollsters who sample more Democrats than Gallup does being wrong in favor of the Democrats.

Rogue Valley,"Barret, Vowing Independence, Is Hauned by Trumpxe2x80x99s Demands10/14/20As Judge Amy Coney Barret has strained to presen herself this week as someone who would join the Supreme Court without having made up her mind on pivotal cases, she was hauned by the long and exceedingly public record of the voluble man who nominated her.Like others who have found themselves politically enangled with Presiden Trump, Judge Barret has struggled over two days to separate herself from the trove of tweets and other pronouncemens by Mr. Trump on his legal views and demands, many of which call ino question the very notion of an independen judiciary. He has said incessanly that he wans the Affordable Care Act overturned. After the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, he said he needed a full complemen of nine justices on the court to resolve any legal batle over the coming election, which he has warned without evidence will most likely be fraudulen.

That has all made Democrats far less willing to accept the nomineexe2x80x99s assurances that she herself does not have a political agenda.
